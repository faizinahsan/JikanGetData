i resurrected my MAL account just to put on record how bad i thought this show was. this has to be the stupidest anime i've ever watched. in the first episode or two i thought, hey, a high-school romance anime that deals with things realistically. no crap about holding hands, it's about the stuff that really went on at school - making out, cheating, sex - and then the rest of the series happened. women prostrating themselves in grief, worshipping, ready to kill and be killed for the harem blob. every episode there was a new romantic 'reveal' that made absolutely no sense. i can'teven put it into words. i refuse to break this down into story, art, character, sound, blah blah - it's just utter shite. \n\n
do not watch this. it gets dumber with every episode, and not in a fun way. i've got to find better things to do with my time.
