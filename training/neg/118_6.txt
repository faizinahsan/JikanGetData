[The Confessions of a Cheating Bastard]
My name is Makoto Ito, and I have a confession to make: “I’m a bastard.” Now, you may ask, why am I a bastard?
Well, I have been accused of having sex with several women and that during those intense moments, I had a girlfriend. Well, I will not deny that I cheated on my girlfriend.
However, what I will deny is that I approached them, in fact, it was the opposite, those women approached me. They wanted a piece of me. And I gave it to them. Should I have declined their offer?
No. That would be stupid. That would not makeme a man, but a pussy.\n\n
If a woman asks for sex, then I will give it to them. Because, really, I’m the best man there is. And, besides, all those women were stupid and slutty.\n\n
I mean, if you have a boyfriend, why should you go cheat on him for me?\n\n
My only conclusion seem to be this: I got the right stuff and those women wanted a piece of it.\n\n
In the beginning, I wasn’t like this, I was infatuated with a girl named Kotonoha Katsura. She was polite, reserved, and cute. At one point, I was dating her, with a little help from Sekai, and things were good. After awhile, I was getting bored, I wanted our relationship to progress, you know kiss and sex and what not, but Katsura didn’t like that.\n\n
I turned to Sekai to fulfill my sexual urges, and she fulfill them. I never knew how easy that was! I think that’s because she liked me, but I didn’t care. I just had sex and it felt so good.\n\n
And then, afterwards, many women approached me and asked for sex, and I, being the gentleman that I am, had sex with them.\n\n
On the surface, I’m a nice, kind, and well-spoken person, but underneath I’m a lying, deceptive, dishonest, egotistical person.\n\n
But, women don’t care about my personality, all they really want is me and my body.\n\n
If this body leads me to having sex with woman, so be it.\n\n
The End
