well i alwayed loved the naruto series Itachi Uchiha
 is a Fictional character that i truly love from my heart , i feel deply connected to him and his story and sacrifice for his little brother sasuke uchiha was somethin just beautiful and amazing to see an anime that maked my eyes cry so hard that i wasn't sad i was happy because i witnessed such a beautiful thing with my own eyes i feel like a was a blessed that i was watching this show called naruto and i got introduced to these people and you ight laught at me they become my familyin a way we shared happy moments and sad moments , the music was something special that you would listen to hours without getting bored it , now lets start with the boruto review i dont have any thing to say other than its disappointed of a show , not to live up to the hype that naruto was , its just a pathatic to see it going down hill , this show is awfull by all means , please feel your precious time and watch something good worth your time , because boruto is just not \n\n
thanks for reading my review for buruto , i hope you have an awesome day of watching anime , the thing that we have in common :)
