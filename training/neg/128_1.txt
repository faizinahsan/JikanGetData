School Days is the worst anime I have ever seen. And that isn't just some off statement for this review, it is the absolute bottom of the barrel, the lowest bar anime has ever set and ever will set. 
Story 1/10
At first the story seems harmless, a student named Makoto Itou becomes intersted in a girl named Kotonoha Katsura. One of his classmate, Sekai Saionji, helps him get with her, but secretly has feeling for Makoto as well. Sounds harmeless, but then around episode 3, when Makoto starts to lose intrest in Kotonoha, is when it all goes to shit. Makoto proceeds to have sexwith every other girl in the school until (Spolier) Sekai kills him. I will give credit were its due, that it has one of the best ending ever. NICE BOAT\n\n
Art 8/10\n
I have to admit that the animation is very good, and its one of the shows strong points, but it still cant save it.\n\n
Sound\n
Sound 7/10\n
The Soundtrack is decent, but its nothing to write home about. The voice actors do a good job, with the execption of Makoto, which doesn't help the fact that he's a asshole.\n\n
Characters\n
1/10\n
This is where the show really falls flat on its face. The main problem with the show is that the charecters are all HORRIBLE people. They all fit into one of three categories: a Dick (Makoto), a bitch (Sekai), or an idiot (Kotonoha).\n\n
Best Character\n
Setsuna Kiyoura\n
The reason that Setsuna is the best character is because she is the ONLY person in the entire show who cares about someone other then them self. She tries to make sure that Makoto stays with Sekai becasue she cares for her. As soon as she left the story, the show's single light in the darkness went out.\n\n
Worst Character:\n
Makoto Itou\n
Makoto has got to be one of the most despicable character in any media ever. Out of curiosity I checked out the visual novel the show was based on. In that, they dont exactly make Makoto the nicest guy ever, but at least you wanted things to turn out good for him. In this, you wish he would just burn in hell for all the terrible things he did to all these girls.\n\n
Enjoyment 1/10\n
The only emotion you will get out of School Days is anger\n\n
Overall 1/10\n
Despite the decent art and sound, it still gets a 1. Because you can have the best sountrack and animation in the world, and if your story and charecters suck ass, it wont make any diffenrence. School days is so bad. So so so so so so bad.\n
