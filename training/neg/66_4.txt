I was hoping to get an anime as good as Naruto. But that? That is just ridiculous! The characters are what made me watch so many episodes, honestly. I find it interseting to see where Naruto and the gang are, and what they have become, to see what kind of place Konoha has become. The kids could be more developped as characters, as many of them seem to just be clones of their parents (I mean Shikadai is literally Shikamaru 2). But the characters alone cannot save this show. There's no real story so far, and there are TOO many fillers (as expected from aNaruto sequel I guess). More than three-quarters of this anime is filler! And yes, I have done the math and as of episode 78 it is true, they only adapted 10 chapters of the manga, that's nothing!. In my opinion, they should have waited a year or two to properly adapt the manga (I haven't read it so I don't know if it's really any better). I just got tired of pointless filler arcs so I decided to just drop this awful series.
