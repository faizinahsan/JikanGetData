Ah, School Days. It's been given many names..
Such as…a psychological high school drama
…Messed Up Anime Number Two [Number One being Boku No Pico]
And the worst anime ever.
Judging by the score I gave this, try and see what I thought of it.
So, I'll try to make this short. The main character, Makoto Itou, does look kinda cute at first, but then he turns into a guy so pathetic and hungry for women that a complex romance happens that usually has him going out with almost every girl in the show. Honestly, it's even degrading women.
The only decent character that I actually felt sorry for was Kotonoha.You'll find out why if you ever lose your mind and actually watch the show. The others are just stereotypical women with common senses of cardboard and you just want to slap Makoto in the face all the time.\n\n
But, I will give it credit for being better than Boku No Pico and having a decent-ish ending.\n
Overall, if you are a fan of good anime, stay the hell away from this. But, if you are bored and want to see what the controversy is about with this show, go and watch it. Also, at least the animation is the most decent thing in the show.\n\n
Don't say I didn't warn you.
