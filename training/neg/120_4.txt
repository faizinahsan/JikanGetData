- "This anime is ridiculous"
It's tragic, it's twisted and has maybe the best end i've ever seen in an anime, but it isn't psychological, please stop saying that. Now alllow me to explain:
-> School Days is about a love triangle. Starts with Makoto, a shy guy who finds attracted to a girl named Katsura and with help from Sekai, his classmate, he manages to talk to her and start a relationship.. Everythingl good until there, but there are lots of plot twists, and things suddenly go in an unpredictable way ending with tragedy ala some Shakespeare novel. Sounds good right?
- But wait, some of theso called plot twists make you enter in despair and hate almost every character, specially the male protagonist [Makoto], who is a weird mix between a shy, indecisive person and a sex hungry animal that somehow manages to get 90% of the cast to sleep with him. See? Ridiculous\n\n
-> This anime shows us a good amount of dramatic cases in a relationship, the lack of decision to move on, how uncomfortable can be dealing with situations when you no longer love a person but don't wanna hurt him/her, the "denial" syndrome, and the thin line existing between love and obsession, very deep.\n\n
- Still, something didn't make this series enjoyable, and i'm not talking about the despicable characters, i'm referring to certain cases in which you just couldn't believe how nonsensical the situation was.. Chapter 11 is maybe the perfect example, but there are quite a few spread over there. This situations ruined what could have been a very good tragedy story, and turned it up into a ridiculous one.. Moreover, the "normal" parts of this show adopt a soap opera style, something which honestly bored me to death.\n\n
** I'm not a person who demands a lot about the art and sound, so i found them right, although the animation maybe was a bit subpar considering the date of release.. The sound blends well, that means it does the job perfectly.\n\n
So in conclusion, this is a hit or miss show, ones may be fascinated by the unpredictability on the story and for some of the characters' personality, and others may feel disgusted or even sad to see how unreal this so called "psychological" tale can become.. For me it was a miss, i expected a lot of this show and ended up being dissapointed.. oh well, that happens.\n\n
Story: 2/10\n
Sound: 8/10\n
Art: 6/10\n
Character: 3/10\n
Enjoyment: 2/10\n
Overall: 4/10\n\n
You Should See At Least: 5 episodes, from there and if you have read any synopsis you can pretty much tell how the story will turn out to be, also you can get a grasp of the "hate" factor if you reach there\n\n
And that's all from me, first review.. i don't know, i just felt like writing one :) \n
Thanks for reading! \n\n\n
