Comparing Boruto to Naruto (from a hardcore Naruto fan):
The Naruto series started with smaller jutsu that then progressed into more important fights, continuously teasing the audience with the more mysterious powerful people (akatsuki, hokages, ect..) and then building a climax to show you amazing scenes with itachi, the previous hokages ect... You were really immersed into the story, naruto's struggles, sasuke's struggles, the hate and vengance relationship of the shinobi world, not to mention ACTUAL DANGER..
Boruto is non-stop family friendly, the characters are pretty much constantly fucking around whilst exchanging banter during situations of crisis. They immediately jump to the op shit and set thebar really high, completely destroying any interest in the development of the young ninja... They feed you non-stop happy positive music, 0 sad music, 0 proper character development. 0 ambu black ops, a useless chunin konohamaru that can only use the fucking rasengan to save his life, and to top it all off the hokages are so god damn bad compared to their older counter-parts (naruto exempt).
