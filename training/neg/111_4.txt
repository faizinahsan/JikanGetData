When I first started watching School Days,I was a aware of its reputation,being such a contraversial anime,I decided to give it a try and it has certainly lived up to its name.
On first sight,School Days seems like and average Romance,School,Slice of life anime.However,after a few episodes in,I realized it is everything,but average.
The story starts with an average japanese guy,Itou Makoto, who frequently rides the metro to school and has recently caught an eye for a girl in the metro Katsura Kotonoha ,to wich he has taken the liking of.The guy being shy and inexpiernced couldn't gather any confidence to confess to the girl.On the otherhand,in his new class he meets a girl,Saionji Sekai who sits beside him and befriends her.Sekai then finds out Itou has started fancying Kotonoha and so decides to help him gather confidence to ask her out.\n\n
Now,Everyone keeps calling this anime either an utter disaster or a psychological materpiece.I,on the other hand,don't think that either is true.\n
One thing that I can definatley conclude is that the anime is certainly something new and unexpected,as well as surprising.What is odd inthis anime is that it tangles with a contraversial idea of cheating.Some aspects in it could definately be considered realistic.Through the main character in practically represents everything that shouldn't be done in relationships.And although,some people may be in dissmay,calling him immadiately a jerk,having thought a bit about,I have realized not only are there guys like that,but in this time of increasing insolence in sexual acts and decreasing values of relationships,this anime could just be the right thing for opening eyes to people if only looked at in the right way.The characters in the anime do develop,but in a negative way.While the main character develops from a shy unexperienced guy to a lust-craving,sexuall addict and playboy,the girl he first starts dating becomes an obssesingly,attached ignorant girlfriend.As the episodes keep progressing their personality traits keep getting worse and worse,so basically there is no positive character in the story.They all keep lying,cheating,obsessing,lusting ,all of the seven great sins depicted in each person,only in a diffirent way.It's a donwnward spiral of innocent kids who believe that maturity is being in a relationships and engaging in various sexual acts and being badly influenced.It's a sad thing that this could be transeferd onto the real world and it's clear that this becomes worryingly frequent as time progresses and children keep entering puberty earlier ,so they keep DOING mature things without their mind keeping up and results in a series of consequences and that is what this anime is trying to present or maybe it is consequence itself of a growing deviation and regression in our society?\n
The very title 'School Days' opposed to the story of the anime clearly states the changes in our societys' perspective towards what School days should really be like.But maybe I'm delving into psychology a bit too much.\n
It woudl be fair to say that watching this anime was a bit amusing for me,as it was something diffirent,but at the same time I was often frustrated because of various things,such as poor dialogues,annyoing music,shallow and ignorant characters or sometimes over dramatized situations which can sometimes make an american-like soap opera feel ,only in form of a japanese anime.\n
Overall,I can't call this anime neither good nor bad,but bearing in mind it hasn't exceeded in any of the categories such as art,story,character or sound it is bound to get a low mark.However,I would recommend people to watch either way,it might not be a true quality or completely enjoyable,but it offers a diffirent perspective on things and can be thought provoking,which is why some people my call it psychological,although in the essence it is not that.It can make us question the values we bear nowadays.\n\n
