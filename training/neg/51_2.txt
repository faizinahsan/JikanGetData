I've been watching Naruto since it first released. Besides the annoying fillers, the story is pretty much solid for a shounen anime/manga.
But Baruto, I just don't know. Just because Naruto was popular, they can't seem to let go of the profit and decided, "why won't we make a new batch of Naruto-like character calling them their children and make millions again. No need to advertise it, it can sail with Naruto's popularity already." And then Baruto came out.
Same old same old. And whatever Naruto's author did, somewhat has been all wash out. Naruto and Sasuke is not the strongest anymore, they're merely a shell ofthe new "baddies". And just when you thought they're almost a "god".... No! They're not. Because Baruto and the others will surpass them.\n\n
For an anime who wanted to ride with Naruto's popularity. I don't think destroying the core of Naruto just to make Baruto better would make it "much better". \n\n
I can't find any of the characters here in Baruto as charming. The only thing I get is annoyance and irritation. The personality and characterization is over flawed, so shallow that you can't help but to bang your head on the nearest hard object and wish you could just forget permanently of what you have seen.\n\n
This anime is DREADFUL ad best.
