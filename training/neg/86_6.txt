OMFG I just can't believe that I've ever recommended this thing to someone.
It started fine, as a love triangle anime, something like Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, but the more I saw the more I hated it. In fact, its a shame to Kimi ga Nozomu Eien to to be included in the same post with School Days.
The story, at first, was fine. Like I've said before, a love triangle with a pathetic male, shy girl and a hyper girl. But the more I saw, the less it could be called >triangle<. The creators wanted to make it complicated, but in the end it turned outto be pathetic.\n\n
The animation is the only good thing about this anime. the animation and the sound. In fact, I like the art-style here. ;;XD\n
There were some little problems sometimes, but overall it was good. \n\n\n
The sound is another thing that was good. In fact, I cant stop listening to one of the ending songs. ^^&quot; \n\n\n
Character. The characters, all of them, are just the worst. Every single one of them is so pathetic that I cant bear it. In they're place, if was in the same situation, I would die rather than being so pathetic. ._.\n
And if they are pathetic, Makoto is the most pathetic, annoying and disgusting character that I've ever seen. He's just a sex machine, and thats all he cares about - sex. If someone will kill him, I will add himher in my fav list. '-' \n\n
Enjoyment~ hmm. Well, a least its not boring and you'll never expect what is coming next. BUT, the Characters are more annoying in every episode, so every time I watching an episode, I'm in a bad mood for a couple of hours after that. \n\n
Overall - well, its not recommended for someone like me. like I said before, it started fine, there was even a time when I actually  liked it. If Makoto was less sex addicted and pathetic, and the love triangle was just a &gt;triangle&lt;, It could have been a lot better.
