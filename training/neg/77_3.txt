*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*
School Days Creator (SDC)- Hey man, I have a terrific idea for an anime series, based on this dirty animated game I've played!
Japanese Executive (JE)-Okay, I love hentai!  Let's hear it.  
SDC- Well, it's going to be about a guy who is a complete failure at life, an idiot loser who is intensely selfish.  He gets uncontrollably nervous talking to girls, and does nothing with his life. However, the twist is that every girl who meets him falls madly in love.  And he has sex with all of them.
JE-What's his driving motivation?
SDC-To fuck as many girls as possible,regardless of how many lies and betrayals necessary to get there.  \n
JE-Okay, but wouldn't the girls eventually catch on?  Even if at first they love him, wouldn't they dump him at some point?  I mean, realizing your girl or boyfriend sucks is and is a cheater is something MILLIONS of people in the real world go through.\n\n
SDC-Well, that's true.  But I have just the plan to fix it; we'll make the girls equally odious and retarded.  They'll have some degree of human compassion, but along with that, a large dose of crazy and whore to them, as they gladly cheat with the boyfriend of one of their female friends!    \n
JE-  Oh!  You mean like my second ex-wife cheated on me with my former best friend?\n\n
SDC-Yes, exactly!  One will be the reserved, kind-hearted girl named Katsura who, upon realizing her boyfriend is a cheater too cowardly to break up with her, becomes a catatonic, deranged puppet of a human being.  \n
JE-  Isn't that extreme?  I mean, if Katsura were a guy whose girlfriend was a cheating piece of shit, wouldn't going insane make the viewer hate such a character for an unnecessary, psychotic reaction, not sympathize with them?\n\n
SDC- True, true.  We need the viewer to side with her, as no one else will be the least bit worthy of compassion.  That's why she'll be drawn very cute and sexy.  That's why we'll have every other girl in the series utterly despise her, even if there's no actual reason for them doing so.  That's why the other main character, Sekai, will betray and sleep with the main character Mokoto behind Katsura's back. \n\n
Sekai will at first seem sympathetic and even kind, helping Katsura and Mokoto to be together, but eventually, she'll turn selfish, soulless, and moronic, as she initiates make-out sessions with Mokoto while he's still dating Katsura.   \n\n
Then, she'll be surprised that someone who cheated WITH her then starts cheating ON her.  Haha.  \n\n
JE- Uh, okay....but what kind of a series is this?  You mention lots of moronic, pitiful girls sleeping with a moronic, pitiful guy, and betrayal and insanity.  What's the hook here, exactly?\n\n
SDC-Ah, that's my master stroke!  School Days will, for most of its 12 episodes, be a straightforward romance series, but then, in the last episode or two, will turn gruesome and bloody.  \n
JE- But wait...isn't that just a cheap plot device to make up for how bankrupt the characters and the rest of the story are?  Isn't that just a shock tool to distract the viewer from the fact that they just watched a brainless romance series based on a hentai game?\n\n
SDC- That's right!  But what we'll do is try to make it SEEM as deep as possible!  You know, like foreshadowing, great music random flashbacks, all that jazz.  Then, if people still criticize it, we can just say that they don't get the deep "story" and moral of the series.  \n
JE-  You mean it will be like a Dostoevsky novel, except with none of the actual logic, depth, or basically anything else redeemable about it?\n\n
SDC-Exactly!  And one last brilliant idea!\n
JE-  Well, right now I'm still not convinced about the show, but go ahead.  \n\n
SDC-  The series will double as a cell phone advertisement!  Everything will happen via cellphone, it will be a huge part of numerous plot devices and episodes, and we'll even have an ending theme prominently featuring one!  \n\n
If we can't get any more blatant, let's have one of the girls excitedly want to buy the latest brand of cellphone for herself and Makoto, for no apparent fucking reason. Hell, let's also have Chibi versions of the characters hawking oversized cellphones during the parts reserved for commercial breaks!\n
JE-....\n\n
SDC-Well...\n
JE-Hmmm...\n\n
SDC-....\n
JE- IT'S BRILLIANT!!!! UTTER GENIUS!!!!  LET'S GET IT DONE!!!!
