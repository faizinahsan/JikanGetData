There are few shows that make you truly put yourself in the shoes of the protagonist as School Days. That being said, be prepared for one of the most complex and lovable main characters in anime if you intend to watch this show. Yet, despite all the empathy, feel-good moments, and moral lessons present, the show itself isn't the most recommendable thing.
School Days is the story about a boy named Makoto struggling with his undying love and affection in a cruel world trying to take advantage of him. With a cast of predominantly crude females trying to erode his incredible spirit, you'll smile every timehe manages to come out on top; I won't spoil it here, but the understanding and sheer consideration the main character possesses in the face of adversity is inspiring to say the least. \n\n
Of course, that's where the show's story shines, but it also has some less sightly aspects. For instance, this is a drama, which means it moves slow, and if you couldn't tell by the title, it takes place in a "School" during "Days," which is as exciting as it sounds at times. It's easy to be bored, at least before getting to know the illustrious depths of our male hero's goals, but once invested, you may weep with passion.\n\n
It doesn't help that the art is rather dull, being barely passable as something to look at. Some characters look nearly identical and that's rather misleading. They seem cute and bubbly, which may be artistic subversion, as it's quite a dark world our innocent Makoto inhabits. \n\n
Sound isn't much to write home about, but what you can write is one of Makoto's amazing, heart-felt speeches to his adversaries. It wouldn't surprise me if the script for this show was written by a politician; this character knows how to move a crowd. \n\n
Overall, if you want to experience an enlightening, warm character come...out on top of it all  with a will to triumph against all odds, you must watch this show, even though it's mostly slow and uninteresting.
