Okay, so this is my first review. Here it goes.
 So, when I first watched this I was like, "Cool! This looks so great! The style is great, the plot can lead to many different directions and the OST is EPIC! I mean, people getting trapped in a video game and have to defeat 100 bosses? I look forward to lots of action!"
 FALSE.
 The first 3 episodes were good, but then it turned into some stupid romance with no character development, what-so-ever! So, now, I will rate the anime.
Story-1
 I would give it a 4 because of the whole, defeat the bosses to escpaedeath thing, but that was really only like, 3 episodes in the entire thing, infact,\n\n
*SPOILER* they move onto a different vide ogame after. *SPOILEROVER* \n\n
They could have had  such a great story coming from the whole "main" plot. Like each arc could have been 1 boss/floor. But the there were time skips, that just made the story even worse because Kirito, the main character, goes from some okay guy, to the most powerful guy out there! HOW? Then, as soon as he \n
*SPOILER* asked asuna to marry him*SPOILEROPVER*\n\n
 I was like, I'm done with this! It tricked me, an action lover, into thinking it was an action anime, but then it turned into a stupid romance with a pathetic action scene here and there. There were also a lot of plot holes. and they were BIG plot holes. I don't want to give anything away,though.\n\n
Art 8\n
The art was actually really good, one of the things that drew me into the anime at first. The outfits, backrounds, colour, and such, all wonderful.\n\n
Sound 10\n
 I LOVE the music. Yuki Kajura does it again! The sound track is so beautiful, I still listen to it. The best part of this anime was the sound track:) EPICNESS! It's too bad the anime wasn't as great as the OST.\n\n
Character 2\n
The only good character was kirito, but even he wasn't 3 dimensional. He was perfect. Too perfect. Everyone else, I hated, especially asuna, she doesn't even deserve a capital at the beginning of her name. Kirito was WAY to good for her and all she was good for was cooking. Also, they didn't even focus on any other character besides Kirito and asuna. They didn't even focus on the bad guy. \n\n
Enjoyment 3\n
 Did I enjoy this? The first 3 episodes? yes. The rest? NO! It was always Kirito going around making girls fall for him and then dumping them without really meaning to. It wasn't even significant to the plot. I didn't even finish the anime. It was too sad. It went all down hill at episode 3. All. Down. Hill.\n\n
Overall 2\n
 If I find the average, this anime would get a 5. (4.8, but I rounded it) I gave it a 2 because this anime almost made me cry. In a bad way. It was that dumb. It had SOOOOOO much potential, but the writers killed it. I also heard that the second half wasn't as good as good as the first and if the first half got a 2 from me, I wasn't wasting my bandwith.banwith. what ever it is called. I mean, the best part about the first arc was that if they died in the game the died in real life. That doesn't happen in the second arc. How do I know? I watched the last episode or something.\n\n
*SPOILER ALERT* which makes no sense since they both die at the end of the arc and somehow live. Does that mean they could have died and just left the game peacfully all along? plot hole! *SPOILEROVER*\n\n
Anywho, this was a pretty sad anime, and when i say sad, I mean SAD. Some people actually like it though, so if you like anime with failed plots, give it a try:)\n\n\n
