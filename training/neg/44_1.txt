Okay, if you see my rating you will probably say it's exaggerated. I would answer: so is the "cash-grabness" of this series.
To be honest, Boruto is probably worth more than that. But NOTHING, in my opinion, justifies such dishonesty as Masashi Kishimoto shows with Boruto.
STORY
The anime starts with a very intriguing scene: Boruto facing a certain guy, who claims he killed Naruto and the Shinobi era is over, and who apparently destroyed Konoha. Now this is hyping! This is so intriguing! The viewers will want to know more! What do we do then? LET'S PUT 80 FILLERS IN A ROW!
Seriously, as of today Boruto has77 episodes, among them there are :\n
- 13 episodes that adapt the arc of the movie,\n
- 6 episodes centered among Sarada ; an arc that looks like it's been written for a f*cking SOAP OPERA, as Sarada investigates on her parents and winds up believing her dad cheated on her mom with a woman who she thinks is her real mother.\n
- THE REST IS FILLER!\n\n
At least we get to know more about the situation shown in the beginning, right? WELL, NO! Kawaki hasn't even APPEARED yet. After almost 80 episodes, we are as far of that flashforward as we were in the first episode!\n\n
The only thing worth watching is the adaptation of the movie ; but even then, the movie is better to watch as the art is way better, so there is really no point in watching the anime version except for having a little bit more detail.\n\n
Now, a little word about the universe: I actually love the "next-gen" style, with the new technology and the fact that shinobi may not be useful anymore as technology can even make their moves without anyone using their own chakra.\n
But that's a side that was developed in the movie, and after watching the anime I just don't have the feeling that I discovered more of what I already learned in the movie.\n\n\n
ART\n
Boruto sucks. Period. It's not even as good as the last Naruto episodes. Super simplistic, no light effect, ugly animation most of the time, average environments.\n\n\n
SOUND\n
On that part, Boruto does as good as Naruto: cool seiyuus, awesome OST (thank you Takanashi!).\n\n\n
CHARACTER\n
The Naruto characters have always been a huge flaw of the manga: 95% of them are useless 90% of the time, and the crew really lacks a lot of charisma. The new crew is no exception.\n
If Boruto's struggling with his father's reputation was interesting to watch, Sarada's arc was as shitty as an anime can get, Orochimaru's son is something that shouldn't even exist, and the rest is just a useless bunch.\n
I also don't like what the old crew became. The gen 1 useless bunch is still as useless as ever, Naruto and Sasuke are unsympathetic and Sakura is, well... as usual.\n
Finally, I find some kids are really uninspired. Like, way too similar to one of their parents.\n\n\n
OVERALL\n
Let's talk about how to make an easy cash-grab.\n
Lesson 1 : create the hype right at the beginning. You know people will stay if they hooked up at the beginning.\n
Lesson 2 : don't care about the rest, people will follow as long as they have the bait in sight. You don't even need a clean job, just be as lazy as you can get and relax.\n
Lesson 3 : you lack material? Just take what already exists. People won't care if you show them a story they've already seen not so long ago.\n\n
I've learned all that thanks to Boruto. Because that's what it is : a PURE, DISHONEST, DISRESPECTFUL CASHGRAB.\n\n
I won't say there is nothing worth it in those 80 episodes. But the proportion of worthy stuff is extremely thin, and most of it has already been shown in the movie.
