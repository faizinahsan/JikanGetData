**Plot**
A young Japanese Highschool student, Makoto Itou, is beginning is second his second term at Sakakino Academy. As he usually takes his train ride to the Academy, he spotted a girl who is a fellow student that caught his eye. Her name is Kotonoha Katsura, a girl who also commutes. A new classmate friend, Sekai Sainoji discovers Makoto has a secretcrush on Kotonoha, she helps both of them to get together and then eventually started dating. However, despite all that effort Sekai is developing feelings towards Makoto and grown with jealousy.\n\n\n
Thus, starting to turn this cute love story,\n\n\n
.....into a living nightmare!\n\n\n

**Story**\n\n\n
It's basically a story of a love triangle that can bring so much not only to everyone around them, but also to themselves. This anime is predictable if you know what's going to come up next.\n\n\n
At first when I started watching this anime several years ago, I did recommended to some of my friends who loves light novels and love stories. Yet, little do I know when I've progressed a little further. Y'know in RL when if one person gets into another person's pants is easier than the first one, then I am okay with that. Why, would you ask? Well there is a logical and acceptable way to solve everything and goes smoothly. Which is by telling your first lover first that "it's not working" and break up, wait a few (or more) days to have everything to cool down, then move in with the other lover.\n\n\n
Did Makoto do that?\n\n\n
.....\n\n\n
NO!\n\n\n
Instead, Makoto just moved in with Sekai and forgets Kotonoha as if she's only a memory. Which makes things worst with the other classmates to assume that the logically stuff has happened and Makoto and Kotona have broken up without Kotonoha knowing this. Which makes Kotohona SLOWLY STARTS TO GO INSANE!\n\n\n
Like, I mean.... SERIOUSLY.....\n\n\n
>8(\n\n\n
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n\n
Later, Makoto gets to sleep with four different girls (and maybe perhaps  more off screen) then later meets Kotonoha that he really wants them to get back together.\n\n\n
well.... interesting. \n\n\n
I wonder how Sekai takes this news.\n\n\n
I would imagine not very likely, for it feels like it's a stab in the back.\n\n\n
or more like in the front.\n\n\n
Y'know what they say, what goes around, comes around.\n\n\n

**Animation**\n\n\n
The Animation by TNK is really outdated comparing to what recent animes are now; However... well.... I have to agree that it's actually pretty good back then. If only animated something worth watching.\n\n\n
___________________________\n\n
**Sound**\n\n
The Openings and Endings, in my opinion, are very decent and standard, It's not like making the whole anime worth watching and I have to say skip them.\n\n
The soundtrack during each episode however, is bleh. Not that appealing for me.\n\n
Thank goodness it's not Dubbed, otherwise I would go out of my way by blowing up whatever studio who would green-light this.\n\n

**VERDICT**\n\n
Just as everyone who reviewed this anime I have to agree. Young love is fragile to ones hearts and minds. This anime can be a good lesson to give to young adults who thinks to want a relationship with someone, or already in one, but I wouldn't recommend it so.\n\n
As for me, I..... personally..... HATED IT!!!\n\n
The only thing note worthy for me is how the ending of this anime got delayed in Japan due to recent actual murders that happened in the region. It can be the same local cases as this. Thus replaces the ending with calming music, and scenery.\n\n
oh look a boat! :D\n\n
Some people say, I may have been very harsh on this anime. Y'know what, those people can go ahead and sleep with many different men and/or women before might get stabbed to death or worse because I believe I am not being too harsh on it at all. It's not the kind of thing I would like watching Love Stories. Hell, I would find hardly to believe that ANYONE would LOOOOVE to watch this.\n\n
I wonder..... Why? Who's this anime for?\n\n
This anime.... for me.... has come to be.... ONE OF THE WORST..... ANIME.... EVER TO BE MADE INTO EXISTENCE!!!!!\n\n
VERDICT: 1/10 - WHAT IS LOVE? BABY, DON'T KILL ME! DON'T KILL ME! NO MOE!
