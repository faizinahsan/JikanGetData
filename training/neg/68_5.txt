My first review and it has to start like this... 
The animation was good, sound too but from my point of view the story is just trash. Maybe I was hoping for something better considering Naruto and Naruto Shippuden but this just left me speechless.
I can not believe I spent so much time on this anime hoping it will get better but it did not. The story in particular just destroyed my hopes and dreams considering the only good episodes were those in which  Naruto appearss and maybe 2 or 3 on the side that I may say were decent. The story is boringand makes me feel like the writers are just throwing stuff on the table just to say they did something. There is not the same heart that I grew  up with. The characters have so much potential, the story can go in such a better direction but instead they are sloppy.\n
Considering it's my first review I know I did not do a great job of telling you guys what to expect of this anime in case you want to start it but I'll sum it like this (from my point of view):\n
The art and sound are good but the story and character development are really poor I was expecting so much more. I can not say I did not enjoy the anime up till this point but I struggled.\n
Overall the anime is mediocre at best and if you are not a hardcore Naruto fan I would not encourage anyone to lose their time on this. I mean sure maybe in the future it will get better and I pray that it shall but for now It is not worth watching with the exception of a very few episodes.
