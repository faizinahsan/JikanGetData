School days is probably one of the most boring anime I've watched. I've watched plenty of romance anime and have enjoyed them, but from the first episode I was already bored and only continued watching for the ending, which once I saw I was indifferent about it. So this anime get's such a low rating because it's boring. If you're looking for drama go look somewhere else because if you're like me you'll only be disappointed and bored.
The entire story sucks and takes forever to get going and once it does it ends pretty quickly. I also thought the characters are all rather unlikeable. Ican't seem to find anything to counterblance that. When you have a story that can be done in about two or three episodes you should do it in two or three episodes to avoid boring people who actually expect something well done. So for a crappy prolonged story that's rather who cares to begin with I can't give it a higher score.
