Cue the screaming fans.
School days was a tragedy of an anime if I ever saw one. To put it simply, without complicated extrapolation, the anime was just plain awful.
Story: 
Is there a 0? What story? Was TNK asleep while they edited this show? Without "giving away" any of the few plot elements there may be, I can say that the first eleven episodes build up a hatred for a certain character who encounters...shall we say, an unfortunate event in the final episode. 
Art:  4/10
Well, there was art...Absolutely nothing spectacular. Of course, I'm not one to talk, since I haven't seen much anime to beable to correctly judge a company's work, but I can tell when quality is less than quality. Nothing to scream at, certainly. Oh, was I too vague?\n\n
Sound: 5/10\n
The only reason I enjoyed the sound was because of a certain scene that saved this anime from an evil hate letter written by yours truly. And even then, I was a little disappointed. Nothing awesome, nothing less from TNK.\n\n
Character: 3/10\n
There was really only one character. All the other characters were portrayed as pawns, and sluts in the main character's hand. Sorry if I ruined anything for you, but I really hated this anime.\n\n
Enjoyment: 2/10\n
I enjoyed the last episode, but it wasn't enough to make up for all the time I wasted watching the first eleven.\n\n
Overall: 2/10\n
Overall, the show is still awful, but people are still going to argue that there is some "deep meaning" to the show. My suggestion, get it in your mind that Makoto is a really bad person, then watch the last episode. Not for the weak-hearted~!
