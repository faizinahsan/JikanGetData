Ok so I really wanted to like this anime.  I love the idea of being trapped in an mmo, maybe because I played WoW for a few years.  Unfortunately the writing is god awful.  The story is practically non existant, there's pretty much nothing about advancing in the world and trying to escape.  Each episode seems pretty unrelated and is predictable.  You also literally miss the first 50 or so floors, I understand nobody wants to watch Kirito grind his way up but something here would have been nice.  Whats even worse though is the characters.  Each oneof them is pretty cliche and boring with virtually no interesting dialogue.  Kirito for instance is a super powerful and pure  character who looks like he will always do the "right" thing.  That looks like there is all there is to his character like we havent seen that in a billion other animes right?  Oh and it is looking like he's gonna have some sort of harem, great as if the show couldn't get anymore superficial.  The art looks really nice, although the fighting scenes aren't interesting whatsoever.  I'll probably give this anime a few more episodes but it's becoming increasingly tedious to watch.
