I can't add to what others have said but let me just briefly summarize my opinion, criticism, and praise.
= [ ( Story ) ] =   ****3****
I apologize for such low rating.  What started out as a promising series, SAO lets down its audience with weak plot and conflict resolutions.  The periodic and time lapses between episodes cause confusion and misunderstanding.  Without your ability to access primary source (LN), some of the plots are unclear, if not simply misplaced.  What remains of the plot?  Instead of focusing on serious aspects of the story, we are dished with series ofMC's love interest, which serves zero purpose to actual  love interest of MC.  Harem is a word that fits this situation.  The excessive amount of fan service that this story vomits is unjustified and unnecessary.  However, SAO delivers simple and understandable plot objectives, which a little child could understand.  There is a clarity in its objective and I applaud the author of SAO for making that very clear.  \n\n
= [ ( Art ) ] = +++ 6 +++\n
the art is very justified for this sort of anime.  With harem, loli, and incest, the cutesy style of art is very fitting and well applied.  At the same time however, it does draw away from the believability of the story as a serious material, which the plot, at least at the beginning, promised to be a very mature topic.  It is fortunate that SAO art tries to please teenagers and casual watchers and opted out for harem/romance/damsel in distress plot devices.  \n\n
= [ ( Sound ) ] = """" 8 """"\n\n
Excellent music--one of saving grace of the series.  It adds excitement to otherwise boring and repetitive action scenes, which seems to overuse charging and 360 degree back and forth.\n\n\n
= [ ( Character ) ] = """"3""""\n\n
Character development is shallow.  MC is given little time for character development.  Little of what does occur uses convenient plot devices [i.e. death of a friend] to advance its objective, which is extremely cliche and unoriginal.  The time given to achieve this objective was narrowed to just one episode, which devastated the impact of the development as a whole.  As well, other character developments are small or absolutely zero.  If there was a little development, it was completely dependent on their interaction with the MC and it is highly unclear whether character development is visible or understandable from the viewers perspective. \n\n
= [ ( Enjoyment ) ] = """""6"""""\n\n
SAO is fairly entertaining, due to its cliche plot and high production value.  The forced incest drama is really the highlight of this show, so I highly recommend it.\n\n
= [ ( Overall ) ] = """"5""""\n\n
I would like to think that 5 is justifiable by my reasoning.  I would've given it 7 or 8 if it weren't for the horrible pacing, weak character development, and overall hype that is given to this show.  IF the show was focused instead of trying to be everything (harem, romance, incest, tragedy, drama, action, seinen, tentacle, sex), SAO could've been an awesome project.  \n\n\n\n
