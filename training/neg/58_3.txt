Ah, Boruto.
As a fan of Naruto I was willing to give this show more of a shot than it deserves, and to it's credit some episodes are good. Unfortunately Boruto has completely derailed from any semblance of quality, leaving only a few episodes worth watching and a sea of shit and cringe.
The show started fresh, giving a insight into the lives of the previous cast in a totally different perspective than before. On top of that the show boasted good art and animation albeit with an iffy story and characters. 
The first arc with Nue was honestly decent.
It was after this arc that the trendthis anime would follow became apparent.\n
Horrendous fluff and a inversely proportionate relation between episode count and quality. \n
Other than the Naruto Gaiden episode and the Mitsuki episode the art and animation has been mediocre and inconsistent at best. The writing is cringe/10 and everyone sucks Boruto's dick. Glorified insert character for kids much? \n\n
It doesn't help that the current Boruto The Movie readaptation arc is a downgrade in every way but with added scenes that butcher your immersion. i.e: Boruto-sama telling his dumb ass dad battle tips. Naruto is the hokage but also fucking useless. \n
I get that Boruto-sama has a bigger dick than Naruto but come on. \n\n
Soundtrack was good at first, it's old and overused at this point however. \n
The first opening was the best. Kana-boon of course.\n\n
The filler has been unwatchable, the characters have been insufferable(except Hanabi), the writing has been a cringe fest but the sakuga is sometimes good. It hasn't been for like 30 episodes so don't expect too much. \n\n\n
