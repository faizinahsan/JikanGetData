I gave this series 1/10 only because I'm freakin angry :D I really would prefer to hear that Boruto needs time because of manga publishing pace or something like that and wait 3 years instead of wasting my time for kanon/filler episodes.
STORY (3/10)
What story? Actually, I already forgot what all of this is about. 
Within +100 episodes nothing significantly important or engaging happen. Boring, slow, antinostalgic. Naruto, Sasuke or Sakura are not able to fix this overall dissapointment.
ART (5/10)
Once it's crappy, once marvelous. (Nothing new here.)
SOUND (3/10)
It almost never fit and I feel it's worse then Naruto. 
CHARACTER (5/10)
All of them are irritating. My patiencehas ended xd I thought I'll like Mitsuki, but now I just hate him. Just like Sumire, Konohamaru, Chouchou, Denki, Mirai etc. I don't even remember the names of the rest of them. And most importantly: where the f*ck is Kawaki? (the biggest bad guy in the series, if someone has already forgotten) I know I'll have to wait for him especially, but that's how you bulid tension I guess. By showing importat enemies\n
from time to time to the audience?\n\n
ENJOYMENT (-100/10)\n\n
This is the worst part: I feel nothing while watching this. Nothing but pain xD I managed to watch 100 episodes because of curiosity and last pieces of hope for something happen or someone develop. I STILL WAIT.\n\n
OVERALL (1/10)\n\n
I'm sorry Naruto - I hate Boruto xD But despite all this: I'LL WAIT. Maybe (when they will make second season or something xD) my opinion will change. Maybe then I will say that after incredibly appalling beggining, series bloomed beautifully. I want to say that someday, but I won't today.\n\n
