Boruto is the best the art has ever been in Naruto in my opinion. 
However, if you thought filler was bad in Shippuden then you are in for a ride. I swear almost every fucking episode in this shit series is just filler leading up to the next moon dude fight. I will admit ep.65 was dope as hell. Definitely one of my favorite fight scenes in anime. But that one fight scene doesnt entirely make up for the fact that half of boruto is about choji's fucking kid and OP lil boruto. 
This is what I wished would've happened. After Naruto: The Last MovieI was hoping for a continuing series based off of the events in The Last (mainly because Hinata looked her best in that, most of the characters actually). But nope, we get boruto and all character design goes to shit. Characters in general go to shit, story goes to shit, etc. Arcs? what are those? here's an "arc" about chojuro trying to suck some actor's dick. smh.
