If you've watched the Boruto movie, skip to episode 67. Between eps 1-67 there is almost zero character development, everything you see 99% of it was covered in the movie. From 67 onward its like one big filler...there isn't much that happens, they have a few side missions, eps 70-80 have some character development like...some... 
::::spoiler alert::::
::::basically eps 70 to now (87) is an ultra crappy version of lets bring Sasuke back!::::::::
what a disaster of a show. I'm ashamed for watching even 10 episodes let alone 87...I keep hoping something will happen, something that will peak my interest.
Around 83-87 is when things seem to getinteresting but then quickly die down. Quite unfortunate really. I highly doubt I'll continue the show.\n\n
Update* watched up to episode 98\n
Story: 3/10\n
Art: 8/10\n
Music: 6.5/10 (shippuden had way better scores)\n
Potential: 9/10 \n\n
Spoiler alert---If you haven't seen shippuden stop reading.\n\n
So the show really has potential be better than Naruto, but, it will be difficult to do that since the writers of Shippuden wrote themselves into a corner with the whole final boss practically god level and then the final final boss was whopped quite easily lol. With Boruto they have an opportunity to fix power levels, and bring back that intense someones gona die feeling. Around episode 90 Boruto starts to develop into its own show (finally) but still nothing is actually happening aside from this one arc that ties into bringing someone back to the village (in a very sasuke-naruto fashion). Potential is still high for the show...here's hoping the next arc will bring it up to par.\n\n
I'll continue watching for now..\n\n\n
