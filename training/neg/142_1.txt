Oh dear... Oh dear oh dear... Seeing reviews for this going any higher than a 5 really makes me loose little faith in humanity... Calling this piece of bubo puss a "deep psychological" anime puts it on the same level as good anime, such as Evangelion, Serial Experiments Lain and Aoi Bungaku. It's not. I'd go as far to say that this is the worst anime I've ever seen.
The characters. No development or progression. At all. We see the main character progress from a complete and utter c***, to !SPOILER ALERT! a dead complete and utter c*** because he acted like a complete and utterc*** throughout the entirety of the series. Bitch A is your typical air headed, big titten harem love interest, then you have bitches B, E, D, F, G and f*** knows how many more all trying to f*** the c***. I knew nothing more about any of the characters by the end of the series that I didn't already know by the end of the first episode.\n
 Art. Not great, not really that dreadful either. It's watchable. \n
Sound. Every piece of music is very forgettable.\n
Story. Hooray, we get to watch some horny tw*t fuck everything that has a pair of breast with no remorse or poor feelings towards anyone. If the plot were even remotely well executed, I may just let it go but it's not. It's just awful.\n
The only enjoyable thing about this anime is the ending, seeing Makoto (the c***) dying was one of the most satisfying resolutions to an anime ever. And seeing the credits roll afterwards, knowing I don't have to drag myself through any more. This anime is pathetic, it does nothing new, executes none of it well at all and has generic, undeveloped characters. I'd sooner rate Boku no Pico a masterpiece than give this any higher than a 1.
