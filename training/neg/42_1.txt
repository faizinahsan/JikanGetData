Boruto is a trainwreck. I can't believe that it took me 31 episodes before I finally accepted how awful it is.
Boruto tries to capitalise on Naruto nostalgia but has nothing going for it. 
The characters are lacklustre at best. The animation is atrocious half of the time and there is zero plot development. It feels like the story is just bumbling on and skipping any of the episodes will have resulted in me missing nothing.
Boruto (the character) is the worst part of it all. As the main character, 80% of his identity is the fact that he "hates" his dad, Naruto. The fight scenes areall boring to watch with no real cost to their outcome and kids who aren't even genin yet beat jounin level shinobi constantly.\n\n
As someone who's watched Naruto and Naruto Shipudden, I have to say I'm disappointed.\n\n
Don't waste your time. Skip this one.
