First of all, this is my first review on MAL and I must warn you 'bout my not-so-perfect English.
Some people can call this anime «psychological drama» or even «psychological thriller». Well, it's not. This anime is just a pack of bad things. And the worst of them is our main hero. If you think that he's Regular Japanese Schoolboy, you got it wrong, 'cause he is Regular Hentai Garbage-Hero. He just fuck any girl on his way without any hesitation, logic and reasons. Any new girl he met will fucked by him. First couple of episodes he tell us (viewers) that he want to havea girlfriend, go on dates and other stuff. Well, it's not — he just wanna fuck'em all.\n
The second bad part of School Days are girls. Yes, all of them love main hero. And yes, same shit again — without any hesitation, logic and reasons. He's not handsome, not kind, not gentle, not a good friend, he barely talk with those girls. He's just nobody but every girl wants his dick inside them. Well, Setsuna can be an exception...\n
And one girl get pregnant by him. And what that jerk doing? He broke up with her. Why? 'Cause he want to fuck other girls! Of course!\n
The only interesting part happens in last episodes. Psychobroken (cool word, huh?) Kotonoha is the only one good part of School Days. She's the only one character who really transform from the beginning of this story to the end. And, I think, the only one reason why I don't gave this anime a 1/10.\n\n
And what we have as result? Meh... We have a pure stupid low-budget trash hentai... without actual porn. And with funny end) And yes, we also have Shiny Days — an actual hentai based on School Days. It's boring regular hentai with poor animation and A-LOT of useless while-sex-talking.
