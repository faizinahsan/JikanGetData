I just finished School days and normally I don't write reviews but I really have this urgency to do it this time !
Before you go on and read further , have in mind :
1.This review has  spoilers , so watch it first before you read this !
2.This anime is not for faint of heart ( people who are easily intimidated ) !! 
also , In my opinion , you have to be at least 16 years old to watch this !!
With that said , I should now start with my review :
This anime deals with genre as Drama ,Harem and Romance or thats whatI read on most websites .\n
That was also what I expected and that was what I got the first 4 a 5 episodes.\n
But the more I saw , the more I noticed this wasn't just another anime series about teens in school having Love problems ,being afraid to confess and full of Clich√© !\n
This anime deals not only with drama ,Harem and Romance but also with psychology .\n\n
The characters are the most detestable cast I have ever seen in a anime and I'm afraid this is not gonna change for long time( maybe never )  !\n
Let me describe the Main characters while telling basic concept of the story :\n\n
[b]Makoto Ito[/b]\n
The protagonist of this series, which seems  normal young men with perverted thoughts at first , turns out to have some ( actually alot ) psychological issues.\n
He suffers from problems like low self-esteem,irresponsible ,afraid of commitment ,sex addiction ,Antisocial personality disorder , etc.\n
Most of the time , he's uncertain , abuse other people (mostly in sexual way ),egotistical,don't think about the consequences and more .\n
He gets a lot of chances which he manage do screw them all trough the whole series .\n
And last but not least ,he is so detestable that you are even happy when he gets killed at the end !\n\n
[b]Kotonoha Katsura[/b]\n
Katsura (the love interest of Makoto) is a lonely ,cute and shy girl who becomes Assertive just when it's late !\n
Because of her unusual big breasts , boys stare at her which is also the cause of her being distanced from the boys.\n
But yet being is interested in Makoto Ito !\n
Being lonely and shy in school while  being bulled by the girls in her class leads to Makoto and Sekai being her light in the darkness.\n
And when she discovers Makoto cheating on her with her best friend Sekai  , she become mentally ill !\n
and that when she slowly becomes Assertive  , which is pretty late .\n
Hurting Sekai ( together with Makoto ) leads to Makotos death which makes her (again) mentally ill and vengeful towards Sekai.\n
At the end , she kills Sekai and has lost her mind.\n\n
[b]Sekai Saionji[/b]\n
Sekai is Makoto's classmate who becomes good friends with Makoto by setting him up with Kotonoha ( while having feelings for Matoko ! ).\n
While she is playful and friendly at the beginning , you discover a whole other side of her trough the series such as : manipulative , too emotional  and most of the time frustrated !\n
After she helps  Kotonoha  and Makoto becoming a couple , she reveals her own \n
feelings by kissing Makoto ( leaving him frustrated which leads to Makoto having regrets of being with Kotonoha ).\n
While she's together with Makoto , she discovers that he has been cheating on her during the school festival .\n
This leads to Sekai  becoming depressed and sad while getting ignored by Makoto .\n
She decide to solve this problem by claiming she caring Makoto's child .\n
This make everything worser , especially for someone like Makoto who is afraid of commitment .\n
Being emotionally hurt by Makoto and hopeless , she decide to kill Makoto ( which she did at the end ).\n
She fails  killing Kotonoha , who reveals her secret ( fake pregnancy ) and threatens her with a bloody dozuki , and gets killed by Kotonoha .\n\n\n
After pointing out most of the bad things of these anime series I want to point out the good things :\n
You learn : \n
1.How strong emotions are\n
2.Be Assertive\n
3.Don't take friends for granted \n
4.Don't cheat on you'r girl/boyfriend\n
5.Think about the consequences \n
6.Respect each other feelings\n\n
There is a chance I missed some other things ...\n
Overall : The only reason I give this anime a 7 is because of the things you can learn and the satisfying  ending !\n
I have to say ,the ending was a bit disgusting and well deserved.\n
It's really give me the chills !\n
But it's not something I gonna watch any soon ! ( maybe even  never !!! )\n\n
Also , since English is not my first language , I apologize for any mistakes I made in this review.\n
