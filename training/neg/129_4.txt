My friend warned me about this anime, that it would make me want to punch something, but you know 'School Days' it sounds like an anime that would be full of slice-of-life and drama and would remind you of your.. school days, but nah. I was wrong.
The beginning was fine: the main dude (Makoto) had a crush on a girl (Kotonoha) and his friend (Sekai) helps him out with getting with the girl, nothing special. Then it turns out that things weren't quite so simple. The conflict was actually Makoto himself, as he constantly ends up doing the dumbest things.
Story: 5/10 
Like I said nothingspecial really happened in this anime, but what surprises me about this anime is the ending and that the worst anime character ever obviously exists and there is potential of becoming a super saiyan just by staring at his pathetic face! I blame Makoto for everything single thing that happened in this anime! The whole time watching the anime is for hoping for the main guy to get hit by a truck or punched in the face but the ending actually gave me more than expected, the ending saved this anime from becoming a one on my rating scale.\n\n
Art: 6/10 \n
The art was fair nothing bad about it but nothing good or surprising about it neither.\n\n
Sound: 5/10 \n
Music and sounds were fine didn't get my heart pumping or anything like that.\n\n
Character: 4/10 \n
There is so many things wrong with the characters. The main girl (Kotonoha), I actually like this character because she stayed faithful the whole time to that piece of crap Makoto and mainly because I felt really bad for her mid way in the anime, but there is still problems with even this character. \n\n
Enjoyment: 3/10 \n
This score is just for the ending. \n\n
Overall: 4/10 \n
Beginning was good then the anime turns into a piece of crap anime.\n
