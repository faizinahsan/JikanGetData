School Days teaches a lesson we should all learn: people aren’t toys, so don’t play with their emotions. The person might just end up breaking.
And after you watch School Days, this will be a lesson you'll never forget.
Itou Makoto has a crush on the shy Katsura Kotonoha, but he doesn’t even have the courage to speak to her. When his classmate Saionji Sekai finds out, she offers/forces Makoto to let her help them get together. Sekai eventually succeeds, and when Makoto asks how he could ever repay her, she kisses him, saying that’s enough. Sekai runs onto the train when it arrives, leaving a stunnedMakoto wondering what in the world just happened. Does Sekai have feelings for him? And could he actually have feelings for her, too?\n\n
School Days starts off as a cute little love triangle, but things quickly turn sour as the show progresses. With great animation, music, voice acting, characters and plot, School Days is quite an interesting experience.\n\n
In most anime that have love triangles, you can easily guess who the main character will end up with. However, in this anime you can never quite tell. \n\n
In most anime that have love triangles, whoever didn’t end up with the main character might be disappointed, but they know that their broken heart will heal over time. But that doesn’t always happen. And School Days shows just that.
