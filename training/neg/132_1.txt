First of all School Days is not what it seems. After finishing school days I felt like I needed months of therapy and bucket loads of anti-depressants. If you had a cheating spouse or have just gone through a bad break up and have a lot of pent up hateful feelings towards your ex this is the anime for you my friends. 
This series has some of the worst characters in the history of anime. There was not one character I could sympathize with. The first few episodes were not so bad. Actually the story developed pretty well and held my interest. But then itwas like the writers just lost their minds or had a nervous breakdown and just wanted to mentally scar the audience for the rest of their lives.\n\n
School Days starts off as a romance anime which has the potential to develop into a typical love triangle story but then becomes something completely mutated and distorted. I wouldn't even call it a psychological anime because other than the fact that it leaves you mentally disturbed after the last episode there is not much depth in the story or psyche of the characters. The characters just seem to do things senselessly without any good reason and it all just seemed devoid of any passion or motive to me. \n\n
 It is nonetheless quite a disturbing anime so I would recommend a marathon of romantic comedy anime after you finish School Days.       \n
