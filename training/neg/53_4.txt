The series have changed to very childish mode at episodes around 25-31. Awful shit.... I really love seeing the old characthers and how they show of their mighty. And I wonder why the fuck the animation is much better quality when for example you see Naruto or Sasuke on screen and for example Sakura fighting against the Sharingan dude, but when Boruto and his friends are doing some shit or like some random Kagura is on screen the quality drops drastically.... I hope we get back on the track again and we see stuff that happened in the movie or something. Meanwhile we are stuckat these fucking slow-paced fucktard characthers like Kagura is. At least include the Bridge called "Naruto" to the end of this arc FFS! And talk about how Naruto changed the village and now his own son came to fix a few things so the mist village stays in peace. I started watching the Black Clover resently and I actually wait for those new episodes more than this shit right now. And then there's the Attack On Titan season 2 of course (only watched like 2 episodes).
