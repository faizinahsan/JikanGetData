whoa.. sorry for the offense but i think that the three main characters and the others who desperately fell for Makoto too, are big idiots. Of course, it may be their first experience towards a relationship but the hell! C'mon, they are so low! They should at least have pity on themselves.
Anyway, I still completed it because I thought the ending would be much better than I expected it to be. But false alarm, I was so dissapointed. I didn't mind Makoto a bit 'cause I thought he deserved it. Yet somehow I felt sympathy for Sekai. If only she had common sense at thetime before she agreed to practice with Makoto. \n\n
So disgusting :C
