NOTE: English is not my first language and this is my first review ever.
This will be pretty short and straight forward without any spoilers.
Straight up garbage, don't waste your time until actual canon episodes start comming out. I can't believe how much time I am wasting watching this trash of a show, I tried so hard to delude myself into watching this just because it's the Naruto Universe but in the end it just left me frustrated.
Story 2/10
Reason behind this grade is simple, there is no story. There were a few "canon" arcs that don't make much sense, but some of them atleast put somemediocre fighting.\n\n
Art 8/10\n
Art is definitely much more appealing to the eyes, but I would prefer old school Naruto style.\n\n
Sound 8/10\n
It is pretty good considering the budget.\n\n
Characters 3/10\n
The only character I like in Boruto Series is Sarada, every other character seems like a bad combination of their parents. Pretty much all of them look generic and you can hardly like them.\n\n
Enjoyment 3/10\n\n
Last 10 or so episodes started triggering me so much that I started skipping minutes. I can say that I don't enjoy watching this at all, but since I started it on release day I will torture myself to finish it.\n\n
Overall 5/10\n\n
I would give it even lower but Art and Sound is pretty solid. \n
Don't get me wrong I love Naruto series and I want this show to succeed, but how they started I don't see it comming any time soon.\n\n
