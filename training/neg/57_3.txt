This anime is a joke and a waste of time  , the entire show is filler where nothing remotely interesting goes down , the manga this show was based from only updates monthly and has like 30 chaps out ( march 2019 ) yet it received an anime back in 2017 that still on going , And it's fucking horrible , they claim that the show content Isnt filler and that itscanon bur you and i know better , i sat through 80+ plus episodes of this cancer and the only plot relevant things that happned were things that were covered in a movie2 fucking years ago , this show is an appalling blatant cash grab that Pulls on your love for naruro to drag you into watching filler , the cast is bad and dry and designs are just them copying the mom and dad mashed versions down , the plot is meh ( considering we only got 5 mins of it ) the soundtrack is good . Overall the 80 eps I saw the only fun I had was when the og naruto cast was in here which speaks volumes of how fun this show really is , bottom line avoid it like a plague , honestly the money spent wasted on this shoudve gone to black clover so that it can get better in animation , cuz that SHOW is acutally good and has a actual plot that ACTUALLY FUCKING  PROGRESSES AND A CAST  thats likeable
