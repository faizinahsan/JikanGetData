*Might be some spoilers*
After completing 100 episodes I can confidently say this show is TERRIBLE!!
All the Naruto fans expected some great things but we were just let down....
THIS IS MY SINCERE REQUEST TO STUDIO PEIRROT ANIMATE BORUTO SLOWLY WE WANT QUALITY NOT QUANTITY. Even after 2 years the quality is just pathetic. If they made 3-4 seasons and spend their budget wisely rather than just blowing it all off slowly without any quality it would be sooo much better
Looks like Studio Peirrot spends most of their budget on Black Clover and just gives Boruto literally NOTHING... with the quality of the animation
Art- The art isjust ok its really choppy everywhere even the fight scenes are just boring with no dynamics or camera movements\n
I would rate this at POTATO level animation just Terrible...\n
After watching Mob Psycho 100 Season 2 and looking at boruto's fight scenes its just pathetic\n\n
Sound-\n
The OSTs are nothing great. The songs are just OK. If Boruto had got something like Black Clover's openings it would be sooo much better.\n\n
Character-\n
MOST TERRIBLE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. the story has more useless fillers than anything in this world it just makes the story more cringy.\n
Like there was this character with this weird crying jutsu LIKE WHAT!!! \n
Boruto does not get any decent development KONOHAMARU is literally worse than Boruto Sarada and Mitsuki even though he is the Sensei.....\n\n
Enjoyment - I really wish there was something enjoyable but there is literally nothing....\n\n
Overall-\n
Yes Boruto had some good episodes like the Naruto Sasuke v/s Otsusukis and the Sarada arc was good too but the rest just Pathetic terrible and (i'm running out of words)......\n
If boruto was animated by Studio Bones or some other studio it would have got justice but the way the current studio does it is really bad. \n
Just dont watch as it is of now because i can tell u that it is just a waste of time\n\n
