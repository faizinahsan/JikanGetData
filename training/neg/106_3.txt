The rage i have for this anime is so overwhelming that I am seriously contemplating filling this review with nothing but fuck loads of swear words.
I fucking HATE this anime.
Ladies and Gentlemen, do NOT be deceived by the title of this anime, it is not as innocent as one may think. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for animes that surprise you and turn out to be slightly more disturbing than one may expect, so it was'nt the element of surprise that put me off this anime...
NEVER have i come across such pathetic excuse for characters in my anime life-span. The girls are weak,stupid as fuck, annoying, and disgraceful. And as  for the one main male character (known as Makoto) .. ... Well where the fuck do I even begin.\n\n\n
It's unbelievably complex to describe why i hate Makoto so much without any spoilers, so instead enjoy this list of British swear words that perfectly describe him:\n\n
- Dickhead\n
-Twat\n
-Cunt\n
-Bellend\n
-Wanker\n
- Bastard\n
-Plonker\n\n\n
Don't get me wrong, there are moments in the anime that are quite funny and show tremendous potential. The first few episodes looked promising, especially with Sekai's personality leaving one to think 'awww isn't she just so cute.' (She alone is the reason why this anime is a 3/10 and not anything lower.As for the other characters... well just watch the series and you'll see for yourself how pathetic they are). \n\n\n
It really is a shame how much this anime sucked.. the story had so much potential.. But before you know it any excitement or positivity felt towards the series will gradually diminish with every episode.  \n\n\n
Would I recommend this anime to anyone? NO. I also strongly advise any type of feminist to stay away. YOU WILL THROW YOUR LAPTOP OUT THE WINDOW.\n
