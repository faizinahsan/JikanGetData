My notes & Opinion on this anime 
[This portion is meant for people who don't want to read the whole review.] 
I was going to write this review when I finished the series, but honest to god, I don't think one episode is going to change my opinion about this anime. 
If you're looking for a deep, love love, romantic,tear-jerker anime, then please cancel that batch download of School Days immediately and take this anime off your plan-to- watch list. You won't be impressed by School Days. It wasn't very well thought out, it seemed like the creators were trying a little too hard to make this a complex love story. Even if you're an ecchi, h-game fan you will find this anime to be pretty pathetic.  That's all I have to say.\n\n
This anime is something I don't recommend, but it's all your choice whether you'd like to watch it or not.\n\n
Story\n
Ok. So I thought this would be just a regular cliche high school love story. It seemed a little immature of Makoto to fall in love with Kotonoha at first sight, but you know, that's how most relationships in anime start. Didn't impress me, I was hoping it'd get better. That's when Sekai came in and a little love-triangle started. I actually thought Sekai and Makoto would end up together in the first place, and some how live happily ever after. Think it'd stop there? Ahaha. I wish it did. \n\n
Then the anime just gets pretty irritating. I thought it'd stop at Sekai, but it doesn't. Setsuna kicks in and decides to have sex with him, kinda almost outta nowhere. I wouldn't let a guy violate me for the sake of my friend. Setsuna's interest in Makoto was hinted, but going so far as to sexual relationships is not what I was thinking. Think it'd stop there? Apparently not. Otome comes out of the blue and decides to go at it with Makoto. Think it ends there? Nope. He decides to have a little fun with Hikari as well. This is just high school people. Very unrealistic. Most anime is unrealistic, but come on people. It was a really poor attempt at some kind of sex in the city anime, but worse. In the end, you just find all the characters really annoying, even the ones you liked from the beginning. \n\n
Art\n
Actually, the reason I decided to watch this anime was purely the art style. I had some pictures from the game back in 2005 and thought it looked so pretty. 2 years later, I find the anime and thought it'd be nice to watch because of the art style. I think the only good part of this anime is that you'll want to go out and save pictures and scans from this anime because the style is so pretty. But I think it's another one of those Anime where they put so much detail into the girls, and the guy doesn't look the least bit attractive.\n\n
Character\n
Aah. Where do I start with the characters? I think the good points. The creators did a good job as far as characters and their reactions. All the characters reacted to such situations as any other human would, so that's a plus. It wasn't too over done where you see the characters wanting to commit suicide, and it wasn't too little of emotions shown.\n\n
The bad part is that you think all the characters are idiots. \n
For the most part, it seems that all the characters fall in love with each other at first sight. Even with Sekai. She knew how much of an idiot Makoto is, the way he treated Kotonoha, yet she still is blinded by love and wants to be with him. Some how, I just don't get that. It makes her look dumb when she loses her innocence to him, and that's not what an audience wants to see. \n
You also find Kotonoha to be annoying because she's trying a little to hard to be with Makoto. She's pretty damn persistent. \n
And oh. my. god. Makoto. I don't know. Doesn't he have ANY sense of moral values what-so-ever? I mean, I love dense characters in most anime, but this guy is just terrible. Absolutly terrible. He disregards all feelings of other girls and just wants some. Reading a book for girl advice? Come on. Asking another girl for girl advice? Now that's going too far. Dumping your girlfriend to go for the girl who gives you the girl advice? I don't even know where to begin with how idiotic that is. Most guys in high school are a bit more mature than that. \n\n
The other characters... I feel like they're just there for the sake of being there. Even though Setsuna claims to have a close relationship with Sekai, you just don't see it. Even though Otome claims to have liked Makoto back in the day, you just don't see it. And I don't know about Hikari, but it was kind of all just out of the blue for me...  \n\n\n
Ending Statements\n
I obviously did not enjoy this anime. But hey, there's only one episode left and I never have to see anything from this anime again. Hey. This anime is ok if you honest to god have NOTHING else to do and no other anime to watch, but believe me, you won't really get much from this anime. Nothing deep, but a little TOO serious for something in high school. None of the relationships, nor the characters, have realistic feelings, especially on Makoto. This anime is something I don't recommend, but it's your choice whether you'd like to watch it or not.\n
