An anime with great value for those who liked naruto, but spoiled a bit what was naruto, Naruto himself was the strongest character because trying to recreate one that literally does what he did one that will be in the shadow of the main, nor that they kill naruto he will always be a hero and the strongest in the history of naruto and boruto.
The story will be a complement that will not be able to take the name of naruto from the back.
(I'm not going to tell the story to not spoiler)
ART:
The design is clearly very good with nothing to complain about
SOUND:
The son isnot very different from the naruto, obviously could be better but nothing to ask\n\n
CHARACTERS:\n
The characters are good but clear and everything that has been created from naruto, nothing spectacular and nine\n\n
CONCLUSION:\n
They could create a story with their own new characters and without the influence of the old naruto characters.\n
And my opinion, I do not expect them to like it any more than they respect.
