YES. It is ANOTHER SchoolDays review!
First and foremost I have a split personality and sometimes "it" also wants to write. "It" is a very tidy monster so it will use (brackets) to do so. Ignore him if you want.
"School Days haters. They're Everywhere." 
How far would you let your emotions take you?
For a magnificent and very singular piece of work, a (excentric) ordinary review.
The truth about us humans is: we make mistakes, undeniably make mistakes. Some of us try to go back and turn them into good solutions but others only live on with things like they are.
SchoolDays is a H-game based anime, nothing comparedto what you have ever watched before. One could say it shows the "true side" of dramas/harems. You may like it or hate, however, almost everyone who watched it says it was unique. For modern anime fans it's a must.\n
(This is the "viewers" thoughts, of course.)\n
The production thoughts would be something more like: We made a nice profit from this game... why don't we put it on TV and see if we can make more (honey) money from it?!\n\n
Shall we start with the best elaborated part of it? The Story!\n
Your School Days weren't that awesome? Aren't you glad that you had a ordinary school life?\n
After you finish watching try to answer this question.\n
It's the freshman year for Itou Makoto... blablabla. I won't waste your time with the summary of this story. What you need to know: It was based on a GAME, so don't expect too much. Basically, it follows the well known patern of harems. 50 different writers gathered to write their ideias, then in the 7th day, the director selected the worst of them and gave it to a monkey. The monkey selected the best parts and then SchoolDays were born. Bald with red eyes. (Sorry I digress, lets get back to the topic)\n
This is a story you must (try) to watch without any kind of spoilers (yes I know, even here the synopsis itself spoiled the entire first episode) but make a try because if you do so, you'll (probably) have a way better enjoyment of the series than the ones who already knew the ending. This way you'll keep getting surprised until the very end.\n\n
I'd give 9 of 10 to the characters of SchoolDays. While reviewing we try to give scores based on how this characters were placed into the story, how were they animated and how character development worked. Working with this parameters, it was a magnificient job for a Visual Novel adaptation. Now, if I were to review the characters personalities' (...) \n
Twist this score upside down and you have my rating.\n
The main character is a damn man whore. His only objective is to have sex with almost every girl he meets. (I spoiled? where!? oh...) Fluffy stuff like "other ppl feelings" doesn't mean a thing to him. In order to maintain my dignity here, I won't talk about the girls.\n\n
I would review OST and BGM. Would give it a score and show the good and bad aspects about it (like every other review) but... To be honest, I didn't give importance to it. It was there, of course, but nothing stood out. It was average. So average that I can't even remember any song in particular. The OP and ED were nicely animated but again, followed that clichÃ© pattern. \n
Keep in mind that this isn't a anime that will have heart touching moments with violins in the background like it's usually seen in other romance/drama stories.\n\n
Just like sound, don't have great expectations about the artwork. It is alright. Not perfect. You can notice that it lacks of budget sometimes. For characters, they all had pretty "standard faces" and expressions sometimes seemed distorted. The girls obviously had gorgeous bodies that sometimes appeared with larger boobs like in the bikinis scenes, making you wonder "how I didn't notice it when she was in her school uniform?".\n
Simplifying it, Artwork: As you would expect from a average harem.\n\n
Its hard to measure the enjoyment of this show. You may find it disgusting, horrible, much more realistic than you expected, messed up, perverted... Don't worry! Even if you find it hilarious you're not crazy at all. (Hysterical laughter would better describe it) \n
This is a anime for you to sit back and watch. Don't try to find a "deeper meaning" into it, because THERE ISN'T ONE. \n
There're a lot of reviews about this anime saying it deserves a 10/10 for its "psychological touch" and all this crap. For me, enjoyment is measure by how you liked watching. It doesn't necessarily mean you felt good after watching it, sad stories are also great. However, if you finish it stressed, cursing everyone, or wondering "what the f*** did I just watch?" then my friend, it was CRAP. \n
[FAQ]Is it twisted? Yes, it is. Don't expect a light-hearted school drama.\n
After watching this, you'll feel the need to watch something innocent. Try Lucky Star :D\n\n
 Final score> yeah... worth watching.\n
::Story 6/10 | Characters 9/10 | Art 6/10 | Sound 6/10 | Enjoyment 4/10 | Overall 6.2/10::\n
Thank you for reading my nonsense. (triyed hard to not make a "nice boat'ed" review)\n\n
