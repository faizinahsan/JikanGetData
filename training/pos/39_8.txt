Life is harsh as a BETA tester in Sword Art Online. That's why I play solo. 
I've been trapped in this game for so long that I've lost track of time. Good thing the graphics for this game are pretty decent, or I'd probably commit suicide. I don't work well with shitty graphics.
I'm also starting to get the hang of being an elite solo player in this game. I for one, don't have many friends, or intend to make any, because they would probably impede my progress as an elitist. The benefit of being a BETA tester is the fact that I know all thebest ways to grind my levels. Call me a BEATER all you want, but I'm not dying in this crazy world.\n\n
There are some very interesting characters in this game. Agil for example, is this buff 6 feet 5 guy that likes to rip people off with his merchanting skills. We all look like our real life counterparts, so I don't get why this guy is not Pking or something. But he's a good and reliable friend nonetheless.\n\n
There's also a lot of hot girls in this game for some reason. I'm not complaining. I met this girl called Asuna, and wow she's good on the eyes. She's pretty strong as well, and all the nerds in Aincrad drools when they see her. I better not associate myself with her, as I like to stay low profile. However, she insists on bugging me all the time, but I actually don't mind after a while. The people in this game are pretty cool, I guess. But I'm the coolest.\n\n
I'd rate this game a 8/10. Could be higher if some floors weren't as easy as they currently are. \n\n\n
