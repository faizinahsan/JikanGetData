Boruto-an anime which almost no one was excited for,but still aired instantly after Shippuuden ended.
An anime which was criticized heavily by fans of Naruto for becoming 'slice of life' compared to Naruto,which was all action and adventure.
The first 50 episodes certainly are slow-paced,but if you were able to watch the disastrous Fourth Great Ninja war arc, this will be a breeze.Care must be taken not to binge-watch this anime,it is meant to be watched a few episodes at a time.
The one thing that this show is equal to Naruto is in the Characters department.We get introduced to a lot of new and interesting characters,who havegrown up in completely different conditions compared to Naruto's generation.\n\n
Currently,the show is getting better and better with each episode. It is certainly worth watching,specially for those Naruto fans who got disillusioned with Boruto and dropped it earlier.\n\n
Not a single opening till now has been worth listening.\n\n
I would like to conclude by saying that despite its drawbacks,this show is still a must watch for people attached to the Naruto universe.\n
