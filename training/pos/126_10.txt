*SPOILER WARNING*
Yes, I gave this all 10's, which will be surprising when you read my review but I'll explain.
Itou-kun is possibly one of the most appalling, despicable characters I have seen in an anime ever, I hated him with a fucking fiery passion. A tenth of my hate was jealously, however the rest was out of how much of a cunt he is, around episode 10 I was getting worked up, yelling at my TV, repeating calling him a despicable cunt and how I hope he just kills himself before this anime is over. The way he treats people was disgusting, he's cheating with multiplegirls and this conniving, twisted, manipulative cunt couldn't give a shit about their feelings, Katsura-san had gone fucking insane, she was delusional and all Itou-kun could care about was who he was going to fuck next. \n\n
Instead of telling her that he didn't want be with her in the beginning he cheated on her, at this point I was just slightly irritated that he didn't just tell her, but as  the story progressed this got worse, he was just playing with her, all of these girls were his mere puppets. I couldn't fucking stand him.\n\n
At the end, when Sekai drives that knife into him, I smiled, as she continued to demolish him that smile transitioned into laughter. This is what I  was hoping for, nothing made me happier than seeing this boy die.\n\n
Now, you're probably wondering why I gave this a 10, and that reason is because this affected me, School Days had managed to claw out all emotion inside of me, any anime which can cause a person to get this emotionally worked up and give them this feeling..\n\n
Is one brilliant fucking anime\n
