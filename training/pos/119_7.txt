School Days starts as your typical run of the mill highschool love comedy/drama series. As the episodes go, the feeling of Kiminozo sorrounds you until the main character is misleaded by one of the main girls that sex doesn't mean you have to be in love with the person, or less alone care for it; so, we have a typical boy who doesn't stand out, that begins to sleep with basically every female on the school, and  at the same time has a shy and naive girlfriend who is trying her best to overcome her intimacy problems because she loves him a lot. Thegirl that started this whole bizarre plot was the person who sat next to him at class, who then becomes his friend at trying to succeed on dating the girl he likes. This is not your typical love comedy harem series, as it deals with psychological and mental issues of the main characters (mostly at the final 4 episodes).\n
Even when you can't see it, there are strong leads that advise you of the type of ending this series will have. Just remember to look closely and the ending won't take you as such a strong surprise.\n
The music (both theme songs and OST) is superb, save for the generic haremy opening.\n
As for the animation, TNK has proven to be an inconsistent studio, that can produce high quality works in animation such as Kannazuki no Miko, and then you have School Days, who has mediocre backgrounds and inconsistencies on the character design (specially on some scenes of the final episode).\n
Overall I'd give it a solid 7.
