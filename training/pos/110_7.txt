This was probably the most aggravating anime I&rsquo;ve ever seen; yet I finished it in a few days time because it makes you want to see the end. Frankly there&rsquo;s not much point in me writing this review, School Days has been reviewed 45 times already. Seriously, it must be one of the most reviewed anime on MAL. But the more reviews it gets&hellip; the more people take notice and watch it. However, if you also notice that while it has almost 10,000 members, it has only a little over 200 favorites. If you watch this series you&rsquo;ll see why&hellip; it&rsquo;s addicting, but most peoplewould be fed up and baffled over the whole thing.\n\n
Never have I been so entangled in such a despicable story. I hated it, but at the same time I must admit, I liked it. Is this your typical harem you ask? No. No it isn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;d think it might be if you haven&rsquo;t heard any spoilers or shocking exclamations over the show, and you just found School Days at random. You&rsquo;d think it might be the first 5 or so episodes when everything is progressing as a normal harem would. And then&hellip; it gets a little shaken up. You see, the story begins with the protagonist Itou Makoto. At first, the basic concept is that he likes a shy girl named Kotonoha. His newly found friend Sekai helps him, and it turns out Kotonoha feels the same way, etc etc. However&hellip; Sekai actually has feelings for Makoto as well. \n\n
What&rsquo;s more, may I state that also never have I before hated the protagonist as much as I did while watching this series. Basically every girl he met he found a way to hurt them, while completely disregarding their sentiment and only thinking of his own feelings of covetousness and sexual passion. I mean, honestly, as you watch the series, Makoto pretty much takes any girl he can put to bed easily. And for some reason, quite a few girls like him. Don&rsquo;t ask me why, it&rsquo;s incomprehensible. This anime really sets you up for the end so it&rsquo;s vital to watch the whole series once you get started on it; there&rsquo;s no point in dropping it beforehand no matter how annoyed you get (and trust me, you will). You possibly will want to shake the screen, so out of safety precaution to your monitor, please scoot your chair back a bit while viewing. \n\n
Is it entirely Makoto&rsquo;s fault, this screwed up chain of events that you may or may not witness, depending on whether you wish to watch this deranged series? Perhaps not. Certainly at one point Sekai was in the blame, especially to Kotonoha. The other girls were at fault as well as Sekai. Kotonoha, throughout the series, was one of the few who didn&rsquo;t really do anything wrong&hellip; she was the only one who actually lost their sanity, too, which graduated slowly from denial to mental illness.  Nevertheless, if Makoto wasn&rsquo;t such a complete jerk then none of this would have happened. There are moments where it seems he feels resentment towards his actions, and regrets what he&rsquo;s done. But then his further actions prove otherwise.\n\n
The animation is nice. I can't say it's beautiful, but it&rsquo;s pleasing to the eye. They style that the characters are draw in is pretty, and most of the time the animation is consistent and fluid enough. As for sound, the opening was all right, with a somewhat generic sound. I liked the ending themes a little more. But the BGM was very fitting most of the time&hellip; I loved the waltz-type piano BGM that played once in a while.\n\n
Though this series is absolutely frustrating, I must say it certainly knows how to draw the audience in, to be sure. You want to keep watching and watching, just to see if Makoto gets what he deserves. And does he? Hmm, well, wait and see. School Days reminds me of the review quote on the back of Lord of the Flies, which I just read&hellip;\n
&ldquo;Evil is inherent in the human mind, whichever innocence may cloak it&rdquo;. You may like Makoto at first&hellip; but watch out&hellip;\n
