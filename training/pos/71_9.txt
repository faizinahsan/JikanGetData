Why i reviewed it this way you might ask well because as a Naruto fan at first the pacing was garbage to be honest. Nevertheless with 39 episodes out as of now without spoiling content, I will say the character development is outstanding, the art is one i have never seen, and when the action scenes happen which they do regardless of the pacing it is great. People expect it to be like Naruto Shippuden but, lets just face the fact that it is indeed not at all. Therefore it is about Boruto not "Borutos Dad". 
Overall 9/10 
P.S: it's an opinion don,t hunt medown about something i like.
