This is my first review that I am making about any anime because this specific anime (School Days) has to have a review. It was such a compelling story and had a lot of drama. It started out as the normal love triangle. Itou Makoto has a crush on Katsura (A girl from the same school who rides the same train with him). Then he gets help from Saionji Sekai who hooks them up and even she falls for him. 
Well the anime gets more crazy as each episode draws near and I can say there are quite some surprises. Itou Makoto (main character) drawsquite a lot of attention and ends up affecting just about all the other characters in this story. And not in a good way either. Anybody who watches this anime will most likely end up hating the main character. School Days has you feeling all kinds of emotions but I rarely seen a happy moment. You are interested all the way to the end and the end is something you don't want to miss. Even though I kinda figured what was going to happen, I was wrong and the ending took me by surprise and I am still thinking about.\n\n
To sum it up, School Days is not your regular romance story. If you like happy endings, don't watch this. There is a lot of reality in this anime by what happens in the story. \n\n
Story-8- I gave the story a 8 because it never left me uninterested and it just seemed to play out well with a surprising ending.\n\n
Art-9- I gave art a 9 because it great.\n\n
Sound-10- I love the music and it seem to fit School Days nicely.\n\n
Character-7- The characters in this story are kinda pathetic. Where are there morals. Even though most of the characters were backstabbing they seem to bring this anime to what it is now. Great\n\n
Enjoyment-9-I enjoyed every moment of this anime except the backstabbing. The story keeps you interested.\n\n
Overall I gave it a 8 because of the unique story line. You don't see too many anime like School Days. It shows a side of reality and isn't all about the happiness.
