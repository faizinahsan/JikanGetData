The Prodigal Shadow Clone...
I went into this thing thinking what pretty much everyone likely was doing the same, wow, Naruto went on way too long with too much filler I don't even know if I want to try getting into this one or I might be a skeletal husk by the time it's halfway done. Surprisingly though, after initially thinking that I found myself at the end of the most recent episode eagerly awaiting the next one. I honestly got into this show more than the initial airing of Naruto, I was growing out of anime and more into Comedy Central shows at that timebefore Naruto Shippuden finally brought me back around while watching the end of the Great Ninja War endless filler arc with my room mates in college.\n\n
Boruto doesn't seem like the lazy cash-grab milking a cow while beating a dead horse that it initially seemed upon my first notification of the concept. Nope, the show has a lot of heart, great characters, a few fantastic fight scenes and thankfully a much more brisk pace than its predecessor with far less filler. It's a fun idea basing a show around the previous stars of the series being kind of old fogies with new responsibilities bringing order as leaders of the new generation. I always enjoy characters who actually age and develop, which is a large part of the reason Gurren Lagann is still my favorite series point blank.\n\n
If you weren't a fan of the original series at some point, it's doubtful you'll be a big fan of this though I wouldn't totally rule it out. It's a fun show with a good blend of humor and drama that brings back beloved characters and brings in lovable new ones. I'd say give it a shot and you'll know whether it's your cup of tea pretty quickly. Boruto lives up to his predecessor's legacy pretty well and gets a 7 out of 10 from me so far.
