Hello , anime lovers.
(NO SPOILERS & short) - The first 49 episodes are fillers.Some are very good and enjoyable-funny, others are ok and there are some, meh... Still though despite the fact that are fillers still you don't want to miss some important arcs of this episodes. Episode 49 is like the worst episode ever... take a deep breath on this one :/ . Episode 50 is a recap of what happend so far, reminding you the progression of most of the characters. From episode 51 starts the real thing and particularly 2 episodes later starts the Momoshiki Arc (first manga arc). This Arc alsois on the (Boruto:Naruto the Movie)but limitless scenes or dialogues and genuinely not so good like the series. -\n\n
(What i wanted after Naruto Shipudden) - When Naruto Shipudden finished, i wanted moreee.I wanted to see the days of Naruto as Hokage, and the rest characters before the new generation. Some mini arcs, you'know on a peaceful era. When i noticed that this Boruto show its gonna be next i was like: hhmm.. sure, why not.I will give it a shot. Anyway im still gonna see all or most of the old generation. Im not gonna lie, at first i saw some events in the early episodes that triggered me or i was just headshaking negatively. Episode through episode though started to becoming better and much better and eventually i started to love this series. \n\n
-POSSIBLE SPOILERS the rest text-, -Facts-.\n\n
(Future Events) - In my opinion, i expect that in the future propably some important characters are gonna die and the main character will have the fate of a hero with a tragic backstory. Somehow like Kakashi,- but not losing anyone from his team i hope :D. As a manga reader i see good Arc's are coming, better than Momoshikis Arc's. Boruto Greatness Hype!\n\n
(Mistakes from Naruto Fans) - A large number of Naruto fans believe that the Naruto series being milked like a cow (pardon my french). I respect those people who think that Naruto he achieved his goal, become Hokage and thats it- nothing more to see. I fully disagree with those though who they compare the previous episodes of Naruto 1 season with this. For example:''oh we had the zabuza arc back then and here we have what? and blah blah.'' This show is about the next generations and it supposed to show somthing else, different path and not reliving the same things. Other fans think that the behavior of Main Character is disgraceful or disrespectful to his father Naruto before the Momoshiki Arc. I hated this aswell watching Boruto acting like this with his dad issues but lets be honest here...hes not 100% to blame. They are some fans again that they don't see enough action as the previous seasons and that it has too much of 'talk jutsu' and waisting of time. Well... those people either forget and they did started watching from the begin the first Naruto season and were waiting week after week to get dissapoint some times from some boring af episodes or... those who started watching it much later the first season full released and lets say- the upcoming episode of second season was somewhere to 260 next release,'just like in my case' maybe they fast forward or skipped some minutes or entired episodes sometimes because wasn't interesting; If some people still loved fillers-flashbacks-talk&staring from Naruto but don't appreciate atleast the good episodes of Boruto then... what more can i say. I don't know. It seems a bit hypocritical. Anyway, different minds- different thoughts. I heard from someone that is not gonna watch boruto cause Sasuke have one arm.(simple and clear..., right?!) haha, my god!\n\n
-Thank you for your time, dear reader. I hope my review was helpful. Have a nice day.-
