An anime that most children wouldn't appreciate.. You have to be an adult, or at the age where you experienced falling in love with someone else.. You may call the art/drawings to be for youngsters but don't let it fool you because the story line, I guarantee you, its for adults.. 
The anime tells you about how a person is consumed by the gratification he desires for every women he wants.. It's like playing "god" among others.. People may hate this anime because the protagonist of the story is a jerk, yes he is and the good thing about this anime is.. It teaches youa lesson.. A lesson not to tolerate what the protagonist is doing.. And for girls out there, please watch this anime.. It's an eye-opener for all of you, it'll make you choose your "man" thoroughly..  Because relationship, isn't just one-sided, it's not just about the "lovy-dovy thingy" but also has a cruel side of it which is told by this anime..\n\n
This is my favorite anime because the story line may happen in real life.. Those "three" portray how an individual fall in love with another.. Selfish, insane and blind.. So don't tolerate them kids.. Be wise.. =)
