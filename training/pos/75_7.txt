tl;dr the show is decent. Starts off bad but gets better and then devolves into a slow grind, but I have faith things will get better. They just need to pick up the damn pace.
Opening with an observation here, but so far, one of the most interesting subplots in the show has been one of the aspects of the show most regularly critiqued. That's right kiddos, the show actually has a subplot about the fact everyone's character (save for Sarada and like two other dudes) have no drive or ambition and are kind of just there.
Show has a lot of potential but there doesn't seemto be a lot of execution on that potential, however, there is A LOT of set up clearly going on with the show, so Kishimoto is clearly playing the long game on this one.\n\n
Another point to bring up is there is probably going to be some weird things going on. Kishimoto said in an interview that everything in the anime is cannon until proven otherwise. He also said everything in the manga is cannon, but the kicker is that the Anime and Manga have two totally different stories save for a few key events, so either some weird warp heresy stuff is going to go down or they're just going to be completely different things.
