A lot of people hate this anime. I think their reasons are unjustified. This anime is supposed to show what NOT to do in a visual novel. It basically makes every wrong decision for you. Taking the worst possible route. School Days is largely misunderstood and I think it is a good example of something that was taken the wrong way. Anyway, that was my 2 cents. Do with it which you will. I know this review is short, but I'm pretty sure everyone and their mothers have already heard of this anime by now.
