It's really nice to see a fresh new look on this universe, and despite what people say I kind of like the slice-of-life style and I don't mind the pacing at all. When there is action or a fight scene it's really enjoyable and I can't help but find myself liking the characters. It's not as emotional, action-packed or angsty as Naruto but I don't think that lowers its quality in any way. Also, you really don't need any knowledge of the previous series to really get this one. There are some references here and there but nothing too plot relevant.
