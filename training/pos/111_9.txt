**Note**
 Dont be mislead about the title. This Title is a rare gem in a pool. You will HATE the Anime (in a good way). You will also hate Society and your friends for a few days after completing this Anime.
All in all.... this anime made me hate society in a while. Which in a way is a good reaction.
Story-
 What appears to be  your average Romance Anime Story  just got shot and replaced by a psuedo Romance Anime Story. There are some Risque Scenes in this anime, but.... it gets easily overlooked. The story was something I enjoyed, but hated at thesame time. There were ALOT *I Repeat* ALOT of Plot Twists that rivals M. Night Shamalym. But, due to time constraints, im guessing they didnt have any space for more backstory. *which would have been a nice addition* \n
-Ending-\n
I wont go into Great Depth into this part... but lets just say the Ending basically justifies you watching the other 11 episodes. \n\n\n
Sound- Voice Acting was just perfect. The confession scenes really felt like something you would seen in Real Life. Something that I would like to see more in other animes ^^\n\n
Character-\n
The if not, Greatest part of this anime. The character development was really good in terms of the amount of time the writers had to finish the series. The Main Character, Makoto, is someone you will hate. Basically, the whole anime watching him step all over the other main character and supporting characters*which are girls*.  This made me hate him and hoping he was dead by the 4th episode.\n\n
Enjoyment-\n
The Ending justified all the other emotions i felt during this anime. The ending left me sitting on my chair with a blank expression. 5 minutes later... i was going "WTF JUST HAPPENED O_O". I havnet had a blank expression from an anime in quite a while.\n\n
Overall-\n
 Its was really hard NOT to watch this anime. But once you start watching, dont drop it.... the ending is something you really dont want to miss.
