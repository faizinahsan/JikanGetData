Boruto is one of those series where you know what to expect, but you also put too wish was Naruto. Boruto being the after events of Naruto understands that most of its fans are still there watching it because of Naruto. Most of the characters in the story are basically carbon copies of the old Naruto casts after the fan favorite ships decided to get together, and old villains are now friends.
The show does have some of its moments with rare times that at least the main cast has some moments. Characters like Mitsuki and Sarada are very unique, and due to their more unorthodoxparenting, they seem to be the exception to being the clone of their parents. \n\n
Unfortunately, normally writing goes back to copying the same scenarios of Naruto. Lazy writing and betting on the nostalgia of Naruto is a constant theme of the anime, with entire arcs and long fillers mirroring or referencing their predecessor, usually removed of suspense too with it taking place during an era of peace. \n\n
Truthfully, this is to be expected, as writing the story this way makes it an easy cash grab. Hopefully, the characters will develop new identities from their parents and new things can happen soon.
