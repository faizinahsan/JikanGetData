Wow, its hard to say much about this.
I advise not even watching, to the more sensitive, it may hurt.
The one thing about my scores that have to be noted, is that I did not feel happy afterwards, but it was never designed for that.
You have to look at an anime objectively, not subjectively. The story was not soap opera styli'zed as it was not generic, so it has a degree of uniqueness, and it is played out rather well.
Art of course is flawless, and Sound? It had different songs for every ending, which were all pretty good.
Characters fit their roles in unexpected ways, managing toleave most of it unpredictable as to what is happening next (unless someone had hinted it to you)\n\n
So this Perfectly Heartless anime gets a 10. Even though that will be the first 10 I refuse to watch ever again.\n\n
(Also first review,hope it shows the balance and doesn't spoil anything)
