I just want to say, I don't actually hate this anime as everyone else in the reviews do. It's not great, and it's obviously not as good as Naruto, but this has kind of become my guilty pleasure. I mean, at first when he was in the academy, I really didn't enjoy that. Once he became a genin I really began to enjoy it a lot more. So although I know it's bad and I know it's kind of a money grabber, I still enjoy it. 
The one thing I do kind of like is the implementation of more real life and controvercial scenarios. Ifeel like that's probably it's one redeeming quailty though besides the fact I get to see Naruto characters and their kids lol. \n\n
But yea Boruto is basically just my guilty pleasure. I also don't judge it too much because it's directed more at kids, and so it doesn't really have any complex story lines or anything, so try not to judge it too much. -v-' \n
