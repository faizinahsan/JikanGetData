School Days is the first anime that makes me "uncomfortable" during watched and even after finished it. It really pissed me off and makes me excited at the same time. I hate almost all of the characters in this anime. But I could not stop myself to finish this anime as soon as possible. School Days is really different compare to all anime that I've watched. The first two episodes is sweet just like all love stories in general, but after that it made me mad, angry and vexed at the same time. And the last two episodes really made me SHOCK! To tell youthe truth I really had hard time to rate this anime. It's really difficult to give a rating that fit this anime perfectly. I suggest you don't get affected by the rating that I gave. Because I believe everyone will have different perception about this unusual anime.
