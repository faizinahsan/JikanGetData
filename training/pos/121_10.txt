Never. Never have I EVER watched an anime that evoked such a strong emotional response. Unfortunately that emotion was disgust. Human nature has never been portrayed so dark or piercing as it is in the final episode of this anime. I wanted to cry. I wanted to vomit. You must Must watch it.
The people who gain the most enjoyment from riding roller coasters are those who have a fear of heights and can experience that fear in a safe environment. Much the same it is necessary to watch this anime because of it's compelling display of the evil side of human nature. Furthermore, you getto walk away at the end with a new experience of emotions you would rather not use in your day to day life. Which as it happens is another similarity to the roller coaster metaphor.
