School Days is the story of a horny teen boy, his annoyingly timid girlfriend, his side chick, and a bunch of other girls with poor decision making skills who refuse to mind their business. I'm actually unsure of how this anime has gotten so many bad reviews because it was genius in my opinion. It was also infuriating and literally made me sweat from rage.
School Days should be classified as a psychological anime because it definitely deconstructs the harem genre. I initially thought this would be some sappy love story with Makoto finding his true love while making a few mistakes along the way. Iwas only partially right because he made nothing but mistakes. This is not a happy anime. It is full of angst and pain. This depicts what happens if you decide to indulge in your harem instead of being confused and fighting off the women while blushing and stuttering. \n\n
The characters were horrible people. I don't think I've ever hated anyone more than Makoto. Ladies, think of the worst man you can imagine yourself dating. Makoto is this man personified. He is selfish, immature, and generally despicable while having the sex drive of a seasoned porn star. Sekai isn't any better since she actually tries to pretend to be nice. Kotonoha is the only character I really felt sorry for but she was so timid and shy that she just made me yell at the TV mostly. All of the other female characters aren't worth mentioning but they served their purpose. I described them in the first sentence of this review. \n\n
***SPOILERS AHEAD***\n\n
The final episode of School Days is what makes this anime worthwhile and one of the best endings I've ever seen. The last episode neatly wraps everything in a cathartic package and delivers the poetic justice that we all craved. Makoto's affair with Sekai is what started all these problems and he died by her hand. After finding Makoto's corpse, Kotonoha lures out Sekai and avenges Makoto's death on the school rooftop. I've never been more proud. She then validates that Sekai wasn't pregnant by gruesomely cutting her open andâ€¦checking for herself. I had a problem with this because I'm certain that the baby wouldn't be visible to the naked eye at that point but at least it gave Kotonoha some satisfaction. Whether she was pregnant or not, it lead Kotonoha to speak one of the greatest lines in history. The last scene shows Kotonoha peacefully laying on the yacht while cuddling Makoto's severed head, her eyes full of life. \n\n
***END SPOILERS***\n\n
This anime was excellent. I was hooked while absolutely loathing the majority of the characters. I wanted to see how this would end because I knew this would be a different type of harem. The only reason this gets a 9 is because the art style isn't that great. School Days is a must-see that even those who aren't anime fans will enjoy. \n
