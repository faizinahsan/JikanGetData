Overall (9): An ecchi with somehow outstanding work at graphics. It's basically a love triangle (if you still wanna call it triangle) psychological based anime. Main character doesn't realise that he's breaking heart of every girl, but seems like totally ignoring it and continuing his promiscuity. So it's here for us to see what it's like for both sides and what could possibly happen.
Story (7): Itou Makoto seems like innocent student with casual everyday life, until he finds out about pretty girl Katsura Kotonoha, who is travelling by a same train as he does. At the school, he's set next to Saionji Sekai, who actuallystarts to help him with his relationship life.\n\n
Enjoyment (9): I somehow enjoyed this anime a lot. I don't think that it's been too short though it only has 12 episodes. Truth is, I watched this in one day (more correctly - within first 20 hours). So I think most of you guys would just say that you only need 5 hours to watch whole anime, just like me. :)\n\n
Tip: NEVER EVER try to see any spoilers for ending. It's something, that you have to see on your own. No matter what, do not try to find out about an ending. Trust me.
