This is my own opinion, but I think the storyline is almost perfect in this anime. Several events relate to the main one, and gives it a bit more depth perception and understanding. This anime features a lot of action and talking, but the music during battles is what makes this anime really shine out. It may not seem much, but you feel the music just flow through you when the characters fight against a boss. I would have to say though that the events are really squished together. This anime focuses on a world where the players need to defeat the final boss towin, but it skips several months in between. There is almost a different story each episode, which may or may not appeal to you guys, but it is at least entertaining to watch. Some comedy and heavy romance are present throughout this anime, as well as very emotional stories. The animation is very good, and each character or boss has unique looks. If you plan to watch this, I would not recommend that you read the manga first as it would take out all the fun in watching it the first time.
