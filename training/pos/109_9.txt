It was on a rainy day, and I was bored as hell, but too tired to visit some friends, so I thought: Well let's watch a lightweight Anime. I remembered the name School Days, the name sounds like the typical slice of life Anime. Nothing to think about just stare... Well in fact I thought it was one when I started watching it. And at the beginning it even seemed like one! I thought: Yeah another Anime where I get to watch 12 episodes with an kiss as the highlight near the end.
The first few minutes really seemed peacefull... But the difference to "other" sliceof life Anime shows up faster then you think. To hell with innocence, the story takes a big turn, and the protagonist becomes the type of guy, most teenager guys would like to be. Popular with women but nearly none of the girls he sleeps with, thinks of a real relationship with him. It sounds like paradise to the most young boys. In fact when i was younger, i wasn't much different...\n\n
However the story evolves in to an unseen level, in fact, it get's perverted but still somehow deep and interessting. I think the most interessting thing about this Anime is the fact, that there isn't any other Anime you can compare it with. It's somehow shocking that the bright sunny world you get to see normaly, isn't there. I mean the whole Anime is special, but the ending is very unexpected.\n\n
The Animations are great, well they also were in the H-Game. So it was to be expected. The Voice actors are doing a good job and the music is ok. My favourite song was the one used in the ending scene ;): Kanashimi no Mukou he... \n\n
Well to watch this Anime you shouldn't be: prude, or anti sexual. You won't get to see an Hentai but it's ecchi non the less. And hell if you want to watch it, you really shouldn't be underage, it's an role model Anime for the mature audience.
