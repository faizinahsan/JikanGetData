There are a lot of very negative and a lot of very positive reviews about SAO. I belong to the positive reviewers. It isn't great because it has a great plot or really deep characters, but just because it's very enjoyable and fun to watch.
story: 7/10
There's nothing special about the storyline, they just got stuck into a game and have to beat it. The only question you ask yourself is: why does the game creator do this.
In the second half ( wich is worse than the fist half), you ask yourself the question: Where is she?
You'll understand when you watch SAO.
Art: 10/10
If there's one thingthat makes SAO a good anime, it's the art. The game world looks so beautiful that you want to be there all te time you see it and the characters really look awesome. The art really makes this anime.\n\n
Sound 10/10\n
The opening of SAO is very nostalgic and you enjoy it every time you hear it.\n\n
Character 6/10\n
The thing that's really bad about SAO is the character developement and the characters' story. The only to characters that you know something about are Kirito and Asuna. Also ( spoiler ), Kirito suddenly becomes very strong without seeing that he trains or something like that. In a way it's kinda cool, you think: wow! Kirito's strong. But I think it would've been better if you could see him training.\n\n
Enjoyment: 9/10\n
When I watched SAO, it immediately got me interrested. The fight scene's were so beautifully animated and the game world was so beautiful.\n
Also it's just exciting and when an episode ended, you just had to see the next one.\n\n
Overall: 8,2/10\n
I enjoyed SAO a lot, it's definitely not the best anime I've seen but it sure was worth watching. I definitely recommend SAO, you'll not regret it. If the second half was as good as the first half and if the character development was better, I would've scored it over a 9.
