Before you pick up the DVD for this, please note the following. As innocent as this anime seems to be in the beginning, the ending is far from it. As you progress through the episodes, slight nudity, sexual acts and even discreet rape appears. 
This series was based on the hit (methinks) based dating sims game called School Days. The art styles, characters and the plot is almost identical the the series. However it was famous for their three "bad endings" as if you do screw up somehow then you'll be in for a violent bloody scene. The anime, is VERY SIMILAR TO THE GAME.
PersonallyI didn't like it. I really got bored of it. Well, I may not be into romance-drama genres, but this anime was plain old boring and by 3/4ths of it, I wanted to shoot myself. If you like shows with LOTS of drama, love... octagons... (get it? love-square, love octagon) and harem, and a bit of fanservice here and there, you'll love this anime. I will not spoil the ending for you, but this whole anime leads to a WTF-ness factor.\n\n
The character development is quite good actually. Sekai, Kotonoha and Makoto's true nature reveals itself by the almost end of the series. Sekai's nature is revealed, Makoto's sudden change and attitude towards both Sekai and Katsura, and Katsura's despair all spirals down to the conclusion of the story. What impresses me the most, was that Makoto's character was the most similar to it's game counterpart (hint: different people has different opinions and actions, therefore, their endings are different from others). If I say anymore of that, I may be spoiling. \n\n
I recommend you watch this over a one episode a day thing, instead of watching it all in one day.\n\n
Note: Although I personally thought the entire series was a waste, the ending of it, has risen the overall score. I'm assure that if there is some hostility towards an character you dislike, then you will enjoy the ending as well.
