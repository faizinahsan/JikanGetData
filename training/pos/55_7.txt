Boruto the next generation shows the kids of the past main characters and the time ater the ending of the war.I founded the character development quiet good and the art, although most of the eps are mainly fillers and don't contribuit to the story, many say that the story is boring compared to Naruto but we have to understand that Naruto has grown up in a time of war when ninja was the main job you could go for and Boruto the next generation is shown after there is peace between the countries.I also think that the characters from Naruto are given too much spotlight,the story is about THE NEXT GENERATION and I feel like this was added so the Naruto fans will watch. After al in Nauto there was rarely scenes of their parents and where concentrating on Naruto and his friends rather than his parents.\n\n\n
