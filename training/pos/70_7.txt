Been putting this show on hold for awhile, because heck I thought this was just a poor excuse to milk Naruto franchise for a little longer, and this is what I got after watching the first few episodes. 
After that, I got quite bored and had nothing to do, so I try to marathoning Boruto again (which by the time this review is written already has 41 episodes). Gotta say me ended up marathoning from first episode to the latest one and enjoying it surprised even myself. 
Not gonna change my opinion about the first few episodes were awful as hell, but after awhile, theseries become more interesting and giving more emphasize on Parent-child relationship of every casts here, which we don't really have on Naruto. \n\n
So overall yeah, in the end, after awhile, I enjoyed it, and surprised even myself.
