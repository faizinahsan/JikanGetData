Before you hit the not helpful button hear me out, I know as an anime sword art has many flaws, such as pace and consistency. However if you don't look at it as trying to be the next fate zero or code geass and instead look at it as an enjoyable anime that you can sit back and watch in a relaxed way just like you would an action tv show or comedy.
The story of Sword Art Online I have mixed feelings about as I love the concept of the VMMORPG and having to fight for your life and peoples reactions to the situation theyare forced into such as, Denying it, stepping up as a leader, Being a whiny B****or being a player killing fucktard. A large part of the pros of sword art online is that it does a great job of portraying all of this to the viewer in a short easy to understand way, it also does a good job of keeping into the MMO theme that they introduced and it remains consistent throughout the story that that is the environment they are in with constant references to how people play MMOs in real life like brief character interactions and forming clans with friends and going on raids. My problem with Sword Art Online is that it is too rushed, the first half only being about 14 episodes where it could of easily of been done in 30 and then the second half in another 30 episodes, but considering the first half took place over 2 years it lead to alot of timeskips to key events this leads to a waste of potential at times and a character who seems to get infinitly stronger every episode.\n\n
The Art of the shows amazing the studio seems to of put a large amount of effort into the art style especially the battles which were done amazingly, another note about the art is the contrast between the art when they are in the virtual world (Lots of bright colors and well lit) compared to the real world where it is slightly darker and more grey (but not to the extent of taking away from it) this adds to the series themes.\n\n
The sound was one of the best parts of the show the music that plays during battles gets me pumped up and sitting on the edge of my seat, and the two openings of the series do a good job of getting you into the feel of the two parts, Crossing Fields by LiSA does an outstanding job of getting you into the feel of the hectic and serious nature of the first half of the story and Innocence does quite a good job of portraying the more lighthearted feel of the second ark.\n\n
Characters in sword art online is one of its weaknesses, the biggest one is Asuna who goes from a character with the potential to be so strong and independent, to the female sidekick second best to the Protagonist and then to basically princess peach, this upset me so much as I had such high hopes for her as a character. Kirito's development is kind of strange and he is prone to having drastic changes in personality, one episode he is the badass rouge player who fights alone the next he is an angsty bitch (didnt last too long though) and then the next second he is the caring big brother type person. However all these changes do take place in between time jumps so it may be passed off as consistent growth over time and he does stay true to his characterization of being the best player in the game and how he will be a motivator for others. All the other secondary characters dont get much development but that could be seen as a plot device involving the one off encounters you see in an MMORPG.\n\n
As a whole I thought the series was really enjoyable it had a good mix of battles and fun and romance, it didn't go out of its way to try and be great but it always left me wanting more, personally I believe it is this years best anime. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who takes all show to seriously and have to try and find hidden meanings to everything cause it is pretty much straight a forward show.
