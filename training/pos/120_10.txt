12 Episodes. Wow. Pretty much all I want to say at this point.
I was really skeptical about wathing this seies beforehand, but I grit my teeth and made myself watch it, and to be completely honest, I'm really glad I did. It was an awesome series in my opinion, and was weel done too.
Going to split this into 5 sections for commenting, giving each a rating out of 10.
Here we go.
Story 9/10
Now, this isn't normally the sort of anime I watch, but overall, I think that the storyline was actually quite good. There were enough twists and turns in it to keep me interested. Thesettings weren't all that well introduced, but after a few episodes, it was easy enough to tell where everyting was.\n\n
Animation 9/10\n\n
The only real qhimm I have with th animation on this one is the black blood. I say no more, because that could result in spoilers. I did however, do some research and found out the reason for the editing of the blood. Yay.\n
Other than that minor flaw, I really enjoyed the animation, it was quite good.\n\n
Sound 7/10\n\n
Most of the sounds were in place, and fit really well, but I didnt really like the OP/ED, therefore I'm only giving this section a 7. :p.\n\n
Character 9/10\n\n
I think that the development of the characters was really good, and that each episode did each character justice in the right places.\n\n
Enjoyment 10/10\n\n
All in all, I really enjoyed this, and it's high on my rewatch list. Giving it a 10 is the  least I can do for this series, I highly reccomend it to anyone.\n\n
My overall rating&hellip;\n\n
Drumroll, please!\n\n
10/10\n\n
I hope this was useful, and thanks for your time!
