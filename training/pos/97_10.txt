School Days is an anime that looks like a typical romance/harem anime if you're basing from the title, but in reality, it is more complex than that, it's a realistic approach to one of the possibilities that might happen when doing something wrong and also samples what a misunderstanding can grow to.
Story: It has an interesting story that is unique in it's own way, so I can't probably find another anime that'll tackle this kind of scenario so I give it a perfect 10.
Art: I can't deny the fact that the characters are well drawn with regards to emphasizing their proportions, and also supporting/extra charactersget drawn nicely too. 10 as well.\n\n
Sound: automatically a 10 due to it's wide range of good ending songs.\n\n
Character: 8 here since not all characters we're given dutiful roles although the major cast have good exposure and participation with each other.\n\n
Enjoyment: Once you start watching, I doubt that you won't finish this, you'll really get hooked with the enjoyment, for my part though, I felt like it wasn't enought. Perfect 10.\n\n
Overall: If you're an anime fan/otaku, don't you dare miss this title. 10/10 for this masterpiece.
