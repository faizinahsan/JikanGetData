I enjoy this series very much it might be slow in the first few episodes but give it a chance and it will grow onto you.  Many people think that these current episodes in the academy  are not canon but I assure you that they are if you read the manga you will find out in chapter 18. I would say if you  watched Naruto for  just the action and not the character development you will probably not enjoy this series. But if you love character development then this is for you.
I also like the fact that they are not usingthe animation style of the manga because if they did I bet a lot of people would be triggered because Ikemoto's style is pretty different from Kiishimoto's style.\n\n
