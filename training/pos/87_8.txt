I loved this anime in most aspects, it is refreshingly different from the normal cliche school romance, the characters are very interesting and I might say quite realistic, Ill explain why bellow, for now staying in the anime viewer perspective  this show is technically decent although nothing special, the development is twisted delicious with incredible cliffhangers at the end of each episode, becoming rather normal at the start but you always feel like watching the next one quickly. The characters develop interestingly and in an original way, far from your usual innocent kids, I can understand why some people must hate the main character,specially for girls, but thats part of males personality. This is one of those shows where things can go wrong and will go wrong portraying very well how you can screw up if you don't do whats right and how you can get into hellish situations if communication between the individuals fails.\n
In my opinion if its controversial then it did something right, and making a character be so hated (although I suspect only by womens) is definitely an ingenious piece of art.  I recommend this anime greatly to the mature audience out there, i'm afraid the younger will just hate it or dont find any meaning. Watch it and don't judge the characters like their real persons, its a show! \n\n
As a side note explanation I must say the characters are slightly exagerated but its actually a fairly accurate portrait of the modern reality in Japan high schools, if you ever had the chance to travel there and spend some time other than touring around you should understand what I mean, the Japanese society is disturbingly diferent but its not like the lovey dovey animes you see around full of tradition and values, it may be like that in the older populations but the younger Japanese are rotting, values are falling apart and the school system is outdated and inadequate to deal with the present situation. I took my time to explain this because knowing of it you might look at this anime from a different point of view. It may be shocking or hateful for someone who is looking for a fairy tale or a pretty romantic story but humans aren't really like that. All this gives a  different dimension to this show and taking into account there are exagerations for entertainment purposes, overall it can be seen as a critic to Japanese modern society so if your interested in this topic, its a must watch.
