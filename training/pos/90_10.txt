This anime is very psychological and manipulative, so if you’re not into consistent plot twists and an exuberant array of drama then I highly suggest you don’t watch this anime. To add to my suggestion of choice…If you like stories with happy endings, or nice characters, then you’re going to be horrified. This story has an unexpected ending that may not please everyone, as well as characters who are a truthfully jerks. 
Story: The story was magnificent, it was pure genius. I have to admit, happy endings are nice, but they aren’t in line with the truth of reality. People usually don’t get to livehappily ever with their lover. Not only is half of America’s married people divorced, the other half could be cheating or treating their spouse horribly. Now granted, the story isn’t something that usually happens, or really happens at all, but it still shows the depression, anger, and jealousy that can build in humans. The story is a perfect example of a miserable set of emotions too chained and too reluctant to realize it’s abhorrence. \n\n
Art: The stories art was quite magnificent. The quality immediately drew me into the story to an even higher level. For me to watch an anime, no matter how magnificent the story and character may be, the anime has to have good art. And I must say, this anime’s art was beyond my expectations. The characters eyes were beautifully woven and the facial expressions were perfectly intact. \n\n
Sound: The sound was good enough for me to comfortably enjoy the show. The reason sound doesn’t have a score quite as high as the other specifics are because I simply can’t remember anything special with it, or bad with it. In fact, I don’t really remember the sound at all. But that states that I didn’t dislike the sound…nor like it. So I give sound an “8”.\n\n
Character: The characters were nicely made, and fit the criteria of the story perfectly. If Makoto wasn’t such a jerk then the story couldn’t be done correctly. But even so, some of the characters bugged me to no end. Even though some characters were vexating a lot of the nice ones made up for that, and I know the annoyance of the characters was needed for the amelioration completion of the story.\n\n
Enjoyment: I enjoyed this story a lot, and as you can tell by my anime list, not every anime or even a quarter of the anime I’ve seen received a 10. I couldn’t stop watching the series, and all day I would just surmise over the series. I have to say this story exceeded all of my expectations. I never expected for an anime with this kind of presentation to be this good!!\n\n
Overall: Overall I loved this anime, loved it enough to put it on my favorites of anime. I would definitely recommend this story to anyone that wants to view a creation of truth. \n
