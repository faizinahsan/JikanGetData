This is my first review. Bare with me.
People will immediately shut me down for saying "8?! YOU OVERRATED THIS ANIME."
Sorry, I don't believe I did, and I will explain why.
Story: *semi-spoiler* Now we know episode 1 was great. It had a lot of potential. I was thinking "How awesome would it be.. if we had virtual reality MMORPGs like this?" Obviously without the trapping and you die you die situation.
So anyway. The idea there is great. Actually it's pretty fantastic, because it's something a lot of people would want in reality. So we have a great idea, whats next? Oh.. cool we now know there'sa tragedy at foot, and you cannot log out, you need to finish the game.\n\n
Here's the part where people are like "Awesome! Let's see how this turns out!"\n
Then on episode 2 people get confused. Then episode 3 people get even more confused.. and eventually get annoyed and write reviews and get upset. "WAAHHH THIS IS A FAILURE, SO MUCH POTENTIAL LOST *rages* WHY DOES THIS HAVE SUCH A HIGH RATING?" Well I will tell you why. The LN has a 1.5 year time skip, and it's a bunch of arc's.. and we watch these arcs. (Episode 2-6) Are the arcs, it's a bad idea for a series to start with arcs.. but they wanted to do the show chronologically, which for the LN readers.. is a great idea.\n
Let me tell you, after episode 7 it should get better. *I hope* in the sense where.. what I have heard from my friends who have read the LN they say that the episodes 2-6 were arc's taken place chronologically, and the story becomes a lot better. So like I said, bare with the series, watch episode 7.. then 8.. then please edit your reviews to the new standards.\n\n
It's like this (Chronologically if you were reading the LN) Episode 1, Episode 7, episode 8, episode 2, episode 9, episode 3, episode 10, episode 4 (and so on) It's just that in the anime it becomes chronological, while in the manga it made sense. Eventually it all will make sense.\n
For the blunder of causing people to be confused and not explaining it properly: 7/10 for the story. Penalized -1 for it.\n\n
Art: The artwork is amazing, people got all "The backgrounds are awful and they don't move in the show" Well.. obviously. It's a splashwork, in a lot of MMORPG's you will have a boundry.. and beyond that boundry = just simple artwork. Since you cannot interact with it, it usually stays still, and just looks like a wall with a painting, until you come close to it obviously. So I'll give it a 9/10 because.. the artwork is good + puts a little bit of realism to it. (Although I am watching a low quality version of it because I am using a low GPU PC)\n\n
Sound: The soundtracks are unique, and are amazing. We all know it. Need I say more? 10/10\n\n
Character: You get further character development later on.. I am told, but as we can tell from the way the characters act, we actually get a few character development over time, so far so good. This may change in the future but as of now 8/10.\n\n
Enjoyment: 9/10 simply because the idea is great.. the artwork and audio is amazing. The characters are going to be developed sooner or later and they do it gradually. The story is decent, it does confuse people but personally I think it's better but for the sake of others I set that to 7, because really.. the anime shouldn't require you to read the manga.\n\n
Overall: 8/10.. because a 9 would be too high to give at the moment, and a 10 is only for masterpieces.\n\n\n
*This rating may change as the show progresses, since I do not know how it will end and how it will unfold, perhaps the anime will become a big disappointment because of budgeting.\n\n
** Please PM me about anything else. If you need more clarification why I gave the rating and such, don't flame/troll or you will be ignored.\n\n
