I love the show! I think that anyone who loves Naruto should watch it. The character development is very good and so are their designs. Boruto gives the feeling of an updated version of the shinobi lifestyle. It also allows us to understand exactly why Boruto doesn't have a good relationship with his father. Hopefully as the manga grows so will the series. There is plenty of potential for the show and I recommend anyone to watch it. Many people like to give it crap, however I feel that the series is simply giving us a feeling of the characters. The design if very welldone and so is the soundtrack. If you are wanting a show that is very entertaining and fun then give Boruto a chance!
