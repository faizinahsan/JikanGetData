When I started watching School Days, I wasn't expecting a whole lot. I saw the reviews, and it didn't exactly have promising reviews and reception. I watched the first episode, and didn't think much. Wasn't anything to dislike or like. Then, as I started watching the next episodes, and seeing the characters and situation reveal themselves, I was hooked. The main character starts off as a simple, standard, and pretty relatable character. Seeing him turn into a despicable, terrible person, while hurting those around him isn't 'enjoyable', but it's interesting indeed. Then comes the ending, which I won't dare spoil. However, it's probably the mostshocking ending I've seen in anime in a while. The show is disturbing, interesting, gripping, frustrating, and, quite simply, very well done.\n\n
The story isn't anything to write home about, but like many anime I've seen, the quality comes from, well, everything else. The characters are very well done. They're realistic, and to an extent, relatable. Their interactions and decisions under the given circumstances are interesting to see. You genuinely feel bad for the characters, and you will feel some relief with what happens to the main character. The animations aren't over the top, and it looks quite nice. The visuals really add to the emotions and mood of the show. On top of the near perfect characters, the soundtrack is among the best I've heard. I listen to it all the time. Saying it's my favorite ost, overall, isn't an exaggeration.
