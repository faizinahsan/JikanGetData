Welcome to the world where you have a nice little harem with you in it, what would you do? Would you preserve the status quo to maintain it? Or rather choose one girl out of the rest? Or screw it up completely? Unfortunately for little Itou here, he chose the latter one, and hell did he screw up, big time.
Now, notice the lack of the "Comedy" genre that you should be expecting in a school harem.
Let me tell you a few things too, the description here is way too optimistic for this anime. The genre bar is also lacking too. If you're here expecting aHappy-Land ending, I am happy to tell you that you're in for a surprise.\n\n
Don't mess with emotions, kids.\n\n
I stumbled upon in this anime after a friend recommended this to me. He told me it is one of those animes that will end in a pleasing boat ride. I took it in as a metaphor and I could not have been more wrong. The boat ride part was right, but I'm not so sure about the "pleasing" part.\n\n
Looking at the description and the genres, I thought it was your average run-in-the-mill harem anime where the Happy-Happy land forms and where the skies of rainbows and sunshine hit the ground.\n\n
But as I continued to watch this anime, there was something a bit off. Usually there is the problem-resolve stuff in regular harems where a problem would pop up and the Protagonist will fix it and so forth, but problems here seemed like it wasn't solvedâ€”to be exact, it became a much bigger problem instead.\n\n
Basically, this guy was pouring gasoline to a stack of wood on which he already threw a lit matchstick to.\n\n
I don't even know if you should call this guy a Protagonist, an Anarchist seems to be a better definition of this guy.\n\n
The Protagonist is a brute, I found that word very fitting for his character. If you expected clean relationships in this anime like in any other harems, you are not going to like where this one goes. This guy is a polygynic freak and very unsympathetic. Beside him are girls that would do everything after some pathetic smooth-talking from him. This really pissed me off.\n\n
The only reason I continued watching this anime is because I had the intuition that this guy was going to meet his demise. I was not disappointed.\n\n
This is an anime that truly displays what happens if you bring the human emotions to a very unstable variable. \n\n
If you stopped watching this anime mid-way, you don't know what you're missing on.\n\n
//Spoiler Alert \n\n
The last 10 minutes of the last episode had to be the only thing I found amusing so far in the series. A cold-blooded murder from a person he once knew. As a person that likes watching Crime Investigation and such, I felt kind of awkwardly content to what happened. Murder may be illegal and such, but this guy should be an exemption because he the personification of insanity at its essence.\n\n
//Spoiler End\n\n
To wrap it up. This is an anime horror disguised as a seemingly innocent show. For those sick of Good Endings. I don't know where else you could find a jewel as shiny as this. If you like animes where things take an unexpected (in this case, VERY unexpected) turn. I would presume that you will like this one.\n\n
This was absolutely one of the most astonishing animes I have ever watched. I encourage you to watch this not because of the hyped ending, but to show how emotions and bad decisions can have a disastrous effect not only in the 2D world, but also in real life.\n\n\n\n\n\n
