It could be better. It's a bit boring, not as gripping as Naruto. Not that much of a change your life anime, YET, Boruto is heavily entitled. Yes, he has alot of traits from his father, but he's also nothing like his mother. 
If he is supposed to be what Naruto would have been with parents, i dont think I would have taken the time to watch Naruto for as long as I did.
Bottom line is I watch it because I watched Naruto.
But I would be lying to you if i said I dont speed through certain points of the episodes.
It drags, and honestly, Ithink I'm just going to read the manga as I heard its better. \n\n
Good luck!
