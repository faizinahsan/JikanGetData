I'll be honest.  I never planned to watch this...  when I first heard of the follow up to Naruto I was intrigued.  Then I heard the title "Boruto" and thought 'this is the dumbest title ever.  Then when I heard it was the name of Naruto's oldest child I made up my mind to never watch it....  then I did.
I only planned to watch the first episode to laugh at how bad it would be.  I thought,  all my friends and I who grew up watching Naruto and then Shippuden can mock it after and have a goodlaugh.  But then I found myself not hating it.  Actually enjoying it.  Maybe it was because my expectations were basically non existent.  Maybe because I secretly hate myself.  Or maybe it's just not terrible.  Either way I have returned each week and have yet to regret watching an episode yet.\n\n
Story: \n
 I tend to explain it as "what if Naruto had been popular in school from the very beginning?"  That's just how I see it.  The plot is coming along and it's got me hooked so far.\n\n
Art:\n
Pretty much the same style as the originals.  I am honestly surprised since it doesn't look like they tried to cut corners animation wise.  At least not yet.\n\n
Sound:\n
Voice acting is good and the opening and closing themes are catchy.  \n\n
Character\n
Boruto is kind of annoying but when you step back and look at the character you can see why.  His father is the Hokage.  He feels unnoticed by his father and desperately wants that attention he has lost.  He's trying to get out of the shadow of being the song of the Hokage and he'll do whatever he feels is needed to do that.\n\n
The rest of the class is a fun "who's kid is who's" game if you were a fan of the originals.  I still can't believe Ino and Sai got together...  I figured she'd be with Choji...  Also SURPRISE, Shikimaru and Temari got together.  Who didn't see that one coming?\n\n
Enjoyment:\n
Like I said,  I am enjoying it so far.  I mean it's a Naruto anime and it's only like 12 episodes in as I'm watching this sooooo...  plenty of room for everyone's favorite filler eps...  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n
Overall:\n
Can't say I would recommend it...  I say just give it a shot and keep expectations low like I did.  Maybe you can enjoy it for what it is as well.  (I just see it as a way to find out what happened to some of my favorite characters for the most part)\n\n\n\n
