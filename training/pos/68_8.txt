Story - 7
It haven't really started just yet, its slow right now but i do see some great potential.
Art - 8
I like it, it's not the best art i have seen but its up there.
If you want an example of the art in a fights scene look up episode 23.
Sound - 6
I haven't noticed anything special, although that might be a good thing because that means it is good, right?
Character - 8
There's a lot of character development on the new characters and some support from the old ones lifts it up. 
You have to take the new characters like they are, thechildren of the parents we all love. Me myself are as close a carbon copy of my dad there is. So why complain that Boruto is to much of a clone? It is that stigma Boruto wants to escape from, he doesn't want to be "the son of the hokage" he just wants to be himself.\n\n
Enjoyment - 9\n
it may be a tad bit too much of a slice of life in the beginning but after episode 20-25 ich it gets some good action. \n
And the slice of life in the beginning even have a explanation. \n
we are in a peaceful period after a huge war. We have a bunch of new characters. The producer cant just start a war to progress the new characters C development, because we would not have any attachment to them if one would die. If the anime would start in a new war every one would be mad that there wasn't any C development. You do see the problem, right?\n
So i think they chose the best of two worlds to get the emotional attachment to make the action better in the end.\n\n
Overall - 7,5\n
Overall i like it a lot and on that note have a good day!\n
