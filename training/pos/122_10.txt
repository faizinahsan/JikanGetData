This is my first and probably only review I will ever make and please, trust me on this review...
Let me get started with a few things, the story is complex and very realistic, it is kinda messed up as in f***ed up. But nonetheless it was superb and very nice. so It got a 9/10
The art, I dont like this kind of art for this kind of anime, I like SAO and that kind of art, so it got a 7/10 based off of biasedness
The sound, lets not bullshit, it was really good and most of it fit really well.
9/10
Enjoyment would have been a 10if not for the story and my hater for 1 of the characters\n\n
Overall it is a 10.\n\n
PLEASE HEAR ME OUT\n\n
Many of you will hate this review because you think I am crazy. Well, I am not, I am a 20 year old med school student who loved romance anime and this anime put my principals and ethics to the test. This anime was made by someone with a deep psychological understanding of relationships. Im not really into psychological but this anime was amazing. It will be a hit or miss for you, either you will love it or hate it. I loved it. It is hard to explain the plot without giving spoilers so thats why I am cutting this short. Many people are fanboy haters, well, this anime is actually rather amazing.
