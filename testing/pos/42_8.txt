School Days.
Personally, both one of the best and worst anime I've ever seen.
Story: 9
I thought the story was technically excellent. Very interesting and completely not what you expect at first impression.
While I was watching it, I didn't like it, because it made me angry...but then when I stopped to think, I realized, wow, that means it's actually really skillfully done. It makes you feel everything.
Also, the way that they wrapped it up in the end left me speechless. I'm still not even exactly sure how I feel about it, but I think that's how it's supposed to make you feel, and they pull it offin a really amazing way.\n\n
Art: 8\n\n
The art was well done and fitting, and complimented the series well. I'll just say it did its job, since I didn't really think about it while I was watching it. Though something that I did notice was done nicely is the facial expressions.\n\n
Sound: 7\n\n
The music, to me, was simply okay. Like the art, it fit and did its job. (I must say, the opening song grew on me a little bit, but I don't really even remember anything else.)\n
But Kanashimi no Mukou he, the song that plays at the ending, gave it such a haunting and melodramatic feel. I thought it was a really nice touch.\n\n
Character: 10\n\n
I gave this portion a 10, merely because...this is human nature. Everyone has a little bit of good and wickedness in them, and everyone affects each other. And I think they portrayed that beautifully through the characters.\n\n
I didn't like any of the characters, but yet they were so well done.\n\n
All three of the leads, I believe, started out pretty innocent and average. Makoto, pretty much a normal guy, who was just too shy to approach the girl he had been seeking out.\n
Sekai, outgoing and sometimes even a bit boisterous, just trying to help out the guy sitting next to her with his love life.\n
And then Kotonoha, who had that touch of naivety, and was a little on the awkward side.\n\n
It seems like they all had good intent at first.\n\n
Then when they met each other...Kotonoha's insecurity, Sekai's jealousy and guilt, Makoto's confusion and twisted desires...they affected each other, more so bringing out the bitter evil inside each other due to their conflicts.\n\n
Basically, it's hard to side with any of them once you've reached the end of the series, because you realize that all three of them are pretty messed up.\n\n
Even though you'll hate them so much, you'll still sort of have an understanding of what brings about their serious flaws.\n\n
And that's why the characters are so much like people, and wonderfully developed.\n\n
Enjoyment: 7\n\n
It's kind of funny, actually, because I enjoyed thinking about how good the story was more than I actually enjoyed watching it.\n\n
Personally, I also felt dirty after watching it because of how disgusting Makoto becomes, and that took away from my enjoyment of it as well.\n\n
But throughout the whole thing, it's not really so much a matter of enjoying it...it's more that you just get hooked and feel the need to see what happens next.\n\n
Overall: 8\n\n
This anime made me feel so much hatred and anger...but it's really just meant to do that, isn't it?\n\n
Just watching the ending would probably determine how you'd feel about it. It could make you feel disturbed, happy, depressed, confused, indifferent, or just mixed feelings.\n\n
Although, if you watched the ending, that'd kind of give you no reason to watch the series...but I don't know if I really recommend it or not. I guess it really just depends on the person.\n\n
Everyone seems to have a different opinion about this one.\n\n
But me, personally...I think it deserves an 8.
