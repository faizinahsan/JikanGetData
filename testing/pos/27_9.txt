I am personally a fan of this anime as I have loved all the naruto movies and episodes. It is starting off slow with the story slowly progressing along but I feel like after a little while it will become a popular anime just like naruto and be just as successful.
Naruto started off a little more fast paced than boruto but they did say that boruto was going to become a stronger shinobi than naruto so I believe it will get good very soon. I think that most people are just not giving it the chance it deserves because they were expecting it to belike naruto but it is a different anime so I think everyone should give this anime a chance and wait for it to turn out good.
