I keep trying to understand why the School Days grade on MAL is so low. I'm going to give some possible explanations, which obviously does not diminish it as a masterpiece and then tell me whether you agree or not.
1- Perhaps because of the genre School with Slice of Life is not the most popular, and usually most works of these genres do not get good grades, however good some may be. For in general the otakus belong to a specific demography, and the baton shonen are consolidated not leaving much space for the others. Another thing is that a lot of people watched becausethe work was very talked about, however as it was not the genre they would watch, so they did not like it. What makes this anime even more badly rated than most because it has fled its niche.\n\n
2 - Perhaps because of the "bad end", there are other cases of very good animes that because the finals are not those good cliches have suffered scorn, and to this day many point out as being the reason why School Days is "bad." Already in my assessment, the "bad end" is often better than a happily ever after, by daring, by innovation, by realism, by scoring, by passing a stronger message, etc. But that does not mean I do not also like happy endings, just that I will not hate an anime because the ending was harder.\n\n
3 - Maybe and this is what really made the difference is the defamation campaign, this wave was made by both specific sites, by influential youtubers, and by the word of mouth itself. It seems that it has become a kind of hobby to speak ill of this anime, and if a person speaks well it will fall on the weight of being against common sense, soon will be censored.\n\n
4 - It may be alienation, since defamation only has greater effect through alienation. I see people copying the opinions of each other a lot without making critical evaluations. So often they have works sows that are well-quoted and have masterpieces that are barely seen. People in general are very easily shaped and influenced, including the so-called opinion makers, many times they are just copying one another. This is a pity, it's a disgrace, but it's the truth, because Sicrano or so-and-so said the note goes up, or if he says it's bad.\n\n
5 - Maybe he's the protagonist and yes I hated Makoto, but he's a great character. I hate the personality created for him, to her lack of empathy, but I loved the great construction for the anime. Very difficult and daring is to work with a character of this type, but unlike other animes his unpleasant personality has a significant plot function, proof of this is that they could put a more pleasant personality and completely change the story. Unfortunately some people begin to hate the personality of the character, but they do not know to distinguish of the work and by that they evaluate negatively.\n\n
6 - Perhaps it is the intellectual limitation of most of the people who attended, not being prepared for all the load of moral content, of real and common situations that the anime passes. Being exactly for all this load that the plot is rich and is wonderful, but not very accepted by those who want only the fanciful, the playful.\n\n
7- It may be an emotional issue, the fact is that anime leaves many people feeling bad for days. Unfortunately, many people do not know how to differentiate between an emotion from a good script that touched them, from a feeling that the work is bad. Why does the work make you cry or reflect it is bad? I do not think so. When the work is bad it is not what has affected her emotionally, but it is precisely because she has not passed emotion that makes her bad. Soon is the intensity and regardless if it was joy, sadness, confidence, fear, or surprise that should be punctuated.
