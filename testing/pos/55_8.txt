Ok... I'll begin by saying this. School Days Starts of as a regular harem type of  anime . In the beginning, you expect it to be a typical happy-happy sort of show with lots of girls and a lot of higly suggestive scenes but that ends there. Eventually the show develops into something darker and more sinister. The show eventually focuses on the darker side of love. The show eventually centers around a lot of taboo topics such as casual sex, school bullying, underage pregnancies, insanity and even death.
The story itself is unoriginal. It has the typical love triangle pattern you see in mostharem shows. What saves the story from getting a lower score is that it suddenly takes a highly unexpected turn and catches the viewers off guard.\n\n
The art is fantastic. The art really stays true to the eroge* its based on. The characters are drawn great and they are pleasing to the eye.\n\n
School Days should be given credit because of its spectacular array of ending themes. For a short 12 episode anime, it has a hell of a lot of ending themes. From the soothing sounds of &quot;Usotsuki&quot; to the bewildering ballade of &quot;Waltz&quot;, the series has songs to suit anyone's tastes and liking.\n\n
The character development is really good. The main protagonist and everyone else are presented well. You can easily see how each one one them changes as the story progresses. For instance, from a shy introverted boy, the main protaganist turns into a playboy. For an anime with only 12 episodes, the character development deserves praise.\n\n
All in all, I liked School Days. Some people might not agree with me but I myself enjoyed it. I found it very enjoyable. \n\n
How does it end? Watch and find out.\n\n
