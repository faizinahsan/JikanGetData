Personal Opinion\n
When everything was done after the 12th episode.... I stared at my computer screen for a good minute. COMPLETLY speechless.\n
When they said that the ending was messed up.. they weren't joking... This is as messed up as you can get. So what'd I think on the whole?\n
Watching episode 1 through 6, is much like trying to swallow a box of nails.  It's filled with fan-service shots that made me want to puke, characters whom i wanted throw bricks at, and a story that seemed to be written by a middle school girl.  But if you can stomach those episodes... you're home free.\n
Episodes 7 to 11 are a lot more engaging.  While not a whole lot better, there was definitely enough in there in which I could keep watching because I felt like it.  The character interactions are what shines in this part of the series and some of the previous characters that you learn to hate... come back w/ sympathetic qualities.\n\n
But if we're talking about School Days here... It's ALL about the ending.  INCREDIBLY controversial... and something more suited for Higurashi.  That being said... I loved it.  The music created incredible tension and when hell broke lose... my heart was racing.  Did it fit this anime? I don't know... but it sure as hell was memorable. That was a NICE BOAT...\n\n
So overall...\n
Episodes 1-6 = 3.5/10\n
Episodes 7-11 = 7/10\n
Episode 12 = 10/10\n\n
Leaving the final rating of\n
7/10 (though more 6.5)\n\n
Similar To...\n
- Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni\n
Only the ending is comparable to Higurashi
