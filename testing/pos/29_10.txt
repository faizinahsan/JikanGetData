It's a good thing to see once again smth like just before I was watching such a nostalgia from the "Shippuden" came out so do here it goes on I'm really glad that they have continued all of the series making bunch of ep's it is really cool although Naruto grew up along with my age 'till at the end of Naruto;Shippuden Episode I've been watching all of the series together I even remember at around ep 340/360 I was gettin' so hyped that I couldn't wait for the new ep's to come so I decided to fully re-watch again from the start 'till theend probably I have like almost 4times watching shippuden where the real fun as before I reached the 350 ep's while watching everything all over again almost 70 of eps were more out and pretty much It's been a long time - When I was a kid back in 2008 Watching Naruto, he was at the same age as me it moved on along with me, with the shippuden and all that wish I could get back somehow but meh it just goes on-- As far from Boruto I'd expect a lot of stuff again and enjoying even more -- as from the new characters they are all cool in there- I'm glad that they have decided to go further more with "Naruto" not only that the story of Hashirama and Madara was great but the whole thing was just well-made is what I can say- It's all good I would recommend watching it. > "When I was a kid, Naruto was a kid too, th' actual "cool" thing is where, while I was growin' up so he did too"
