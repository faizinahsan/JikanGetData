Boruto series start with good arc but don't know why they shorten that not major progress in story so far. Even 50 episodes released so far but compare to naruto this show is not going far. 
Why you liked: 
Well this show is about NARUTO'S son Boruto.  In first episode preview show some good stuff or i say story that someone expecting in naruto spinoff series. Animations are good and sound too.
Why you disliked:
Even this show about young generation in naruto world, there are nothing interesting to watch. Story or Arc are too short and booring. Everything is like fillers in this series. After50 episodes there are nothing in this anime campare to naruto. Major drawback of this show low rating is that the story and animation  focus for only little kids (PG13 or lower). No Action or Drama just daily life thing of naruto world which they thought are great adventure and action but this is not.\n\n
Conclusion :\n
If you are die hard fan of naruto then you sure disappoint to see this show. \n
Because this show fails to cash the karizma of naruto. \n\n
My personal points:\n
Include some sensefull stories in the series and target larger audiences which do not want to see kids stuff. Include more drama and unique plot twists plus improve character development and thier stories. \n
I am hoping  kishimoto sensai pull some rabbits again into his hat.
