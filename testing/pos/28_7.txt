Actually this series was needed because when shippuden ended it actually never mentioned anything about kaguya's history. I mean to say the story of  Kaguya's ancestors where she came from by now it is known that she never came from the moon ,so in short the mother of the okutsuki clan needs to be explained in this story like what is her ancestorial history and what are her origins and like momoshiki are there any one like them, by seeing momoshiki we think he is of the same origins as of kaguya but whether they are yet friends or foes yet to be knownand most important part of it is why this beings are collecting the tailed beast to revive the ten tails and where did that tree came from from which kaguya ate a fruit and became strong also why did kaguya formed an army of zetsu's from did she wanted to protect her sons from. This part was unanswered by kishimoto this part needs to be answered in this series.\n\n\n
Secondly after watching 14 episodes as of now the story of the foundation formed by danzo who were gone missing after danzo's death was answered and how did they wanted to avenge their outcast from the village was pretty much thoughtful and the character of boruto I would say is 70% Itachi 20% hinata and 10% Naruto and people who are complaining his annoyance I would say to them that Naruto before timeskip was much more annoyable  and he used to do some straightfoward fighting which was brute force which he used with his 100s of shadowclones and got beaten every time had no self respect so he never ever really respected the teachers and nonetheless his fighting was very much awful I mean we all cheered for him when he did something out of the way and his never die attitude  but seriously he acted like a wimp before the time skip.\n\n
Whereas in Boruto's case he never ceases to amaze  people who are complaining how kids can produce so much chakra then please check any eye doctor they aren't very good with chakras so they instead they are well developed in taijutsu skills such as Boruto he cannot produce 100s of shadow clones like his father but he can with his limitation he somehow developed his taijutsu skills while sarada developed her shuriken jutsu like her uncle itachi so they are fun to watch and for this time we actually have a mc who acts like a real shinobi not like Naruto rushing everywhere without any guidance and those who think kids can't develop too much chakras remember itachi he was a jonin at age of only 7 . We never saw the age of kakkashi and itachi or even shisui very closely since they were not mc but we found out that those batches were much more skilled than the Naruto generation because some of them became jonins before arriving their 10th birthday so case in point batches differs you people are saying that because either yo haven't seen Naruto full or you guys are dumb Naruto harcore fans who sometimes even thought Naruto was real.\n\n
Lastly the people who are saying that Boruto isn't as thrilling as Naruto since in the beginning there is no zabuza or orochimaru like characters of course there will be no character like that remember its peacetime now thanks to Naruto and Kakkashi and since orochimaru involving himself and helping aid the injured in the fourth war, his sins were mercy by kakkashi and Naruto so there is no imminent threat like that so in order to establish a threat it has to be extraterrestrial like momoshiki or inside the village like the foundation whose outcome has been shown in 14 episodes there is another threat which may come from the villages itself sort of mentioned by kishimoto , its kind of an uprising between the powerful and powerless I mean between the shinobis and non shinobis that could effect the moral of the whole Naruto world if you keep that in mind you would understand why it was told by Boruto in the 1st episode that the age shinobi is overwith saying that keep watching Boruto it will get darker after some episodes I mean Kishimoto also mentioned it\n\n
Overall I give 7.5/10 for this anime
