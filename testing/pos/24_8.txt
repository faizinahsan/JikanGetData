I don't really understand why Boruto is getting so much hate...
Here's my opinion of it.
Story 7/10
The story of Boruto is slightly more boring than Naruto honestly but I enjoy it because it has absolutely no relation to Naruto whatsoever, it is not a continuation of Naruto which probably many thought it was, therefore the bad rep.
But, Boruto has its good parts and bad parts.
For one, the character development for Boruto is not the best but it certainly isn't the worst, it develops characters through the "eyes" of Boruto much like alot of other animes. Each character has their own character development.
In Boruto what I foundinteresting was that each character had dark secrets they never share until Boruto gets them to tell their secrets. Boruto builds this sort of vibe among his peers which I found was similar to Naruto in which Naruto gets people to change from the most evil being to the guy that saved everyone's life.\n\n
Boruto has a similar thing going. Sometimes the show can be a bore because the war is over and there really isn't much to do except hunt down a few weak Rogue ninjas as missions or fight with peers for combat practice etc etc\n\n
Seeing all the old characters (Naruto) in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations is quite interesting, they are overpowered as fuck just like in Naruto, Kakashi's generation were as overpowered. But, the sight of familiar faces with more developed and cooler powers is quite fascinating.\n\n\n
Art 10/10\n\n
I really love the art style of Boruto it really brings out the modern, bright, colourful world that is Boruto. It's probably also how Boruto looks at the world, not as how it is but as how it could be...\n
I'm fucking quoting shit right now...\n\n
Not to mention character designs, some looks like their parents or a mix but pretty creative in a sense. Boruto has a totally different design from Naruto and Hinata. Well, a slight resemblance but not definite.\n\n
Anyways, the art brings in the "feels" and I personally enjoy it very much!\n\n
Sound 8/10\n\n
I love the music, the OP is very "happy" and suits the animation too!\n\n
Overall 8/10\n\n
An underrated anime. It doesn't have to be a continuation of Naruto... Boruto should have his own story, not one that is written off his father... \n
I think the writer is trying to make that, but not many seems to understand that.
