I like thus continuation of naruto shippuden. There is no shortage of good new characters
-Inojin Yamanaka
-Sarada Uchia
-Mutsuki
-Boruto Uzumaki
The series has not really started yet but it has the potential to surpass naruto & naruto shippuden. 
Boruto is more responsible and heroic in the anime than the manga, it's a change to the better in my opinion. 
For some reason i really look forward to the next episode, this is usually not the case when i watch anime, it's hard for me to get into an anime, maybe it helps that i watched shippuden before starting to watch this. 
It's not very common the writers hasthe balls to start something new with an existing concept but it worked well with digimon and it worked well with this series too, i actually like Naruto better as an adult. \n\n
After watching 35 episodes: i do miss the maturity shippuden and naruto had(blood and torture), the guiden arc had some of it but after that it has been too family friendly for my taste, while there hasn't been many bad episodes this far there hasn't been anything really spectacular either. \n\n
It still to early to judge this anime, they are using a lot of screentime to show off the different characters, it's slower pased than the original naruto where several people where killed within the first 20 episodes.
