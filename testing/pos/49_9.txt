First and foremost, I did not give School Days a 9 because it was a "good" anime. I gave it a nine because this anime has been able to make me feel very strong emotions that no other anime has been able to make me feel - frustration, anger, exasperation, and literally, sick. For an anime to make me feel that way, well, they must be doing something special.
It starts off as a fairly amusing anime. It seems so simple and lighthearted, but you can tell that there's probably going to be some love triangle business. Then about episode 5 or 6, shit starts toget real. I won't spoil it, but it starts to get very upsetting. \n\n
As most other people have agreed, the main character is simply awful, personality wise. However, he's good at his role (being an asshole). I felt very bad for Katsura, because she has to deal with it through the whole time.\n\n
The art and sound were fine. Nothing amazing, nothing awful. I'm pretty sure this anime is only subbed.\n\n
I feel that it's much better to watch School Days with friends. We were able to share our frustrations and for the first half, we had a lot of fun. We made fun of the awkward overuse of sideways angles (there are a ton...). \n\n
Sorry if my review is kind of choppy and short, but I really think that if you choose to watch it (please don't...I'm definitely not letting my boyfriend watch it), at some point, you have to stand back and be able to appreciate how much this anime can piss you off.\n\n
Because seriously, fuck this anime.
