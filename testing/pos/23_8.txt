All of these 'die hard naruto' fans watching the first few episodes and giving it a shit rating, lmao makes me laugh. I've watched the whole Naruto series twice and have watched Boruto up to the 24th episode currently and ive got to say its not even that bad, i actually enjoy it.
Yes the first few episodes may of been slow and slice of life, but the producer wanted it to be chilled out for the first few, he wanted to make the series appeal to the younger generation too, lmao people giving it a 1/10 rating need to get that pole outta their asses.\n
The show gets quite interesting maybe 7 or 8 episodes in, people expect it to be action packed from the start but they're honestly just too ignorant. \n\n
Tbh i like what the producers have done, there are few cons here and there but nearly all anime have their cons, if you're a Naruto fan and are willing to sit through the first few slice of life episodes youll probably enjoy it when the real plot kicks in, don't let all these tight arsed harsh reviews weigh you down, its an alright anime
