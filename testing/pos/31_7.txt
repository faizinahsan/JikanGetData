This will be a longer one. May contain some spoilers, but I'll try keeping it as clean as possible.
I'll talk about particular arcs and lots of stuff so who doesn't want to read it all, the short versions will be at the end of each paragraph.
Story 7/10
To start off, it picks up a few years after the Naruto Shippuden ending. If you are thinking of starting Boruto without watching Naruto first, I do think it's possible to somewhat follow, but you'll miss out on A LOT of stuff and information. Having said that, lets get through this arc by arc so far.
Arc 1: Academy EntranceArc 7/10\n\n
The story follows Naruto's son Boruto, who doesn't want to be like his dad. The war has ended and the need for shinobi is declining. Technology has advanced a great deal. While Boruto is the main character, basically it's a show about the next generation of shinobi in Konoha. The emphasis is on the difference in the mentality of the older and new generation. While Naruto and his generation worked their asses off to get where they are and had to fight stronger opponents with their lives on the line, Boruto and his generation have much less motivation and determination to get to their goal. Unlike Naruto who was always alone as a kid, Boruto is always sorounded by friends and this first arc mainly focuses on getting to know them. Boruto hates Naruto for never being around and is trying to get him to spend more time with him. This goes on through the other arcs as well, so I won't go deeper in discussion over this.\n\n
Short: Getting to know the next generation of shinobi, Boruto hates Naruto, technology advanced, spoiled brats...\n\n
Arc 2: Sarada Uchiha Arc 8/10\n\n
This was a good arc. Sarada is aiming to become Hokage and wants to know about her father and the important stuff that happened in the past. We can see good character developement and a Sasuke that actually cares for his family and is willing to get hurt in order to protect them. Sakura is usefull - yeah, I said it! Forshadowing about some Otsutski stuff coming up. The annoying thing in this arc is Chocho who is searching for her dad as well (even though it's obvious to everyone it's Choji). She is getting in the way of everything and only thinking and talking about food.  \n\n
Short: Badass Sasuke, badass Sarada, badass Sakura, fatass Chocho.\n\n
Arc 3: School Trip Arc 4/10\n\n
A trip to the Bloody Mist Village, even though it's not called that any more. A really bad try at recreating the Haku & Zabuza fight from Naruto. Has the lame new 7 swordsman of the mist who can't even win against kids who are not even ninja yet! Bad character developement and overall a mess. They should have just skipped this arc.\n\n
Short: If you skip this, you won't miss a damn thing.\n\n
Arc 4: Graduation Exams Arc 5/10\n\n
A short 4-episode arc about the lack of motivation to become a ninja from the new generation kids. Again, not particularly bad, but not particularly necessary. It's short so I guess it's ok.\n\n
* not really an arc, just a few episodes * -> big, big Mitsuki developement! 10/10\n\n
Arc 5: Genin Mission Arc 8/10\n\n
Finally some good stuff. The formation of teams and the first mission of the new team 7. We get to see an older Konohamaru and badass is the first thing that comes to mind.\n\n
Arc 6: Byakuya Gang Arc 3/10\n\n
Small character developement for Shikadai. Otherwise unnecessary.\n\n
Arc 7: ChÅ«nin Exams Arc 7/10\n\n
As of writing this review, the ongoing arc. Introduction of a few new characters and some interesting stuff going on. Ninja tech tools are making a big difference and it's a good introduction to them because they are going to be a key point in the rest of the anime. The fights are really not special by any means and they fade in comparison to Naruto fights, but the new Otsuski invasion is interesting and is clearly a bit different from the movie version.\n\n
Short: Starting to get interesting, plot moving.\n\n\n
Art 8/10\n\n
Good character desing and decent quality animation. Key moments really well animated. \n\n
Sound 7/10\n\n
Modernised soundtracks somewhat fitting of the anime and setting, but not nearly as epic and memorable as Naruto soundtracks.\n\n
Character 7/10\n\n
The characters are really mostly just a copy from their parents, with minor changes to their characters and design. (Everyone but Shikadai, he is just a complete copy of Shikamaru. But everyone loves Shikamaru so I don't really mind that.) Overall a 6/10, Mitsuki +1, Sarada +1, Chocho -1 -> Total = 7/10\n\n
Enjoyment 8/10\n\n
Even though it has some faults and needs work, I still love the show.\n\n
Overall 7.5/10\n\n
Really indecisive between 7/10 and 8/10. If it keeps going well I wouln't ming giving it 8/10.
