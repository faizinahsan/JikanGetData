It's all to obv that most people who have seen the first few episodes of Baruto has never seen the original Naruto show. This show does exactly what Naruto did, and that is build fucking character, you don't go straight into the action of killing people off and such before you even fucking know who everyone is. so many bad reviews from people who never got to learn about Naruto as a kid before he became cool, so many episodes in the beginning of Naruto with no action, then a little and then for a long time non. it's the same deal here, so weknow they are serious about building the world of Baruto, while also making sure that everyone is not just doll husks with no actual impact on the whole premise. A true Naruto fan could never wish for more than this, so sad to see MAL be run over by children. sadly it's been like this for a long time now. so if you have a problem leave, and let the adults enjoy there childhood ones again.
