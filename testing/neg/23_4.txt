The fillers have gone so bad for this show that the content is now unwatchable.
If you just want the visuals and the soundtracks, better to just play OP, EDs on youtube.
Haruhi's endless eight is a lot more tolerable than 80 episodes of filler, quality-wise and quantity-wise.
This is definitely becoming a NOT WATCH. People should discourage the production team to continue this any further.
As of 96 episodes and about 2yrs  of airing, the only episodes you will enjoy watching here is Boruto Gaiden (ep. 19-23) and the Chuunin exam (ep. 53-66). So that is currently 17/96 episodes. Your choice if you will still continue asa Naruto fan.
