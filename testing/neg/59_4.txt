words cannot describe how much I hate this show. the characters the story, just about every thing made me mad.
Story- starts out innocently enough with the usual guy trying to get a girl, and he does, in the first episode. and it just goes downhill from there. the guy, Makoto, cant seem to do anything right for his new found girlfriend, so he ends up cheating on her. thats about the jist of it, all thats left is the flurry of lust that follows. with women throwing themselves at makoto, and he just soaks it all in.
Art- the art is about the only decent thingabout this anime. while the character designs were rather bland and didnt offer anything new, but they were clean and crisp with fluid animations.\n\n
Sound- I couldnt bring myself to watch the opening all the way through, nor could I do so for the ending. the voic acting was decent, but again, nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n
Character- This was by far the worst part about this show. all of the characters are greedy and only out for themselves. there is nothing redeeming about any of them. not to mention the total 180 degree turn that the three main characters make about 4 episodes in, they completely change their mindsets. I thought that I could compare to Makoto, because I had gone through similar things. right up until episode 4 when everything changes, from there he just becomes more of a pig just lusting after any woman that talks to him. by the end he just does whatever can get his jollies. \n\n
Enjoyment- two thumbs down. so far down that I had to cut off my thumbs and bury them six feet under ground.
