Now on to the review of what I should call "an extremly overhyped series." Though it is somehow a popular series for its genre, it just didn't appeal to me.
Story: Is it really an outstanding story? Well I can say that it is outstanding for being a mediocre romance story. Even if romance is not the key for this anime, I have a need to critic what is bad, and this is no exception. The so called romance in school days lacked in its true value of what romance should really mean. What starts as a simple boy loves girls actually turns out to bea big fat pool of sexualisation and lust. I'm not actually surprised, since it is actually based on a eroge game. The REAL story actually starts on the second half of the show. Yes indeed, the first half was literally bullshit in the development. For the second half, the big pool I talked about is still there, but instead going for the better, the story debut its journey into a downward spiral which lead to the so called "Amazing ending".\n\n
Characters: All I have to say is that Makoto is probably the dumbest character ever made in anime histories. Am I over the board with my statement? I am not and I'm sure a lots of you would agree with me. I just couldn't find any values for him. As for the defaults that he has, he's selfish, stupid, have no heart and he's a big fat asshole. He's not the only asshole of the story, in fact most of the characters are, but he's still the biggest of them all. As for the female characters, which represents 95% of the population in this show, all have one similar point. They can't control their lust. Every girls in this show(no exception) are portrait as easy girls and sluts. Which is rather disapointing. The psychology made no sense either. You can't just stop loving a girl just like that to love another one. It's actually nonsense, but for Makoto, it happens on a daily basis. \n\n
Art: Not much to say about it. Character art was fairly generic, as for the backgrounds nothing outstanding, but nothing mediocre.\n\n
Sound:Didn't really like the opening and ending, though they smartly use a suspense feeling to some of the scenes.\n\n
Enjoyment: Though the first episodes were not so good, the last ones are what actually makes the show "enjoyable". Emotionally disturbed, Kotonoha is probably the character which made the show enjoyable. I would compare her to Carrie(Stephen King Novel). As for the ending, you would probably expect that since it's the only reason to watch this show.\n\n
Overall: I'm giving it a 5/10. It was enjoyable at some points, but the series still lacked in many aspects(characters for example). As for the moral, I'll just quote something from the song Billie Jean:\n\n
"People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do\n
And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts"\n\n
Enjoy!\n\n
