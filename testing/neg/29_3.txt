Gonna keep this brief: Boruto is possibly the most wasted potential show of anime's history. Boruto may be Naruto's sequel in a literal manner, but the story & theme are NOT.
As of time of this review (~ep 60) the story has been a little more than a failed SOL. There has been one, yes one, unique/main concept so far. And that concept, after an entire arc dedicated purely for it's foreshadowing, has been absent ever since. Over the span of 60+ episodes (avoiding specifics for spoliers) virtually nothing has been completed on Boruto's journey. And it's one exciting unique feature has seemingly been utterly dismissedand abandoned for no apparent reason.\n\n
As for now, I would highly recommend staying away from this show. Not only is it a disgrace to Naruto's fans who've been watching since 2002, it's an absolute failure of an attempt in transforming a high-pace action filled shounen into an E rated kids show; leaving nil mature themes in a shounen- horrendous.\n\n
Story-- 3: as explained above. To summarize: story is absurdly slow and if you are looking for a good action-shounen, you will not find those awesome fights in here.\n\n
Art + Sound-- 6: Your usual shounen stuff, nothing notably good nor bad.\n\n
Characters-- 2: Copy pastes of the originals but worse. The main characters are burrito and salad, and their character design is just as creative as the names.\n\n
Enjoyment-- 1: Every time things appear to become interesting, they don't. The amount of nostalgic epic moments that have been missed so far is disappointing to say the least. It's like Ukyo Kodachi doesn't know a thing about it's predecessor, and if he does, doesn't want to have anything to do with it. I get he wants to do his own thing, but its such a slap in the face to the audience he is inheriting- come on.\n\n
Overall-- 3: Maybe something of interest will happen ~episode 200, but till then, this has been a slow and painful wreck.
