School Days known to be one of the worst anime ever due to popular belief in the anime community. I only went into this out of pure curiosity about how terrible School Days actually is and to give out a personal opinion for the sake of reviewing it. Is it as bad as the anime community says it is?
Story (5/10)
School Days had a mediocre through the first episodes. Nothing really meaningful at the least and some morally idiotic decisions by none other by Makoto himself. It was boring to watch, but first half was overall 50/50. The second half? I'll get to that later intothe review. Now we get to the last two episodes. At the end of episode 11, I was actually surprised that such a scene existed in this dreadful anime. I 'd say it was the best part of School Days. The only good part of it anyways. However, I didn't feel anything that made me feel the scene. In fact, I was still frustrated at certain characters during the scene that it interferes with with the emotion. And we get to the last episode. It's just the three main characters making some of the idiotic decisions ever. The stuff that made the twists are very illogical. This was without a doubt the worst part of School Days\n\n
Art & Sound (5/10)\n\n
School Days doesn't seem too appealing with the art & sound. The Art just seems bland all the way through and there were no soundtracks that stood out to me. The arts overall are just flat out mediocre. However, the arts are the least of problems.\n\n
Character (1/10)\n\n
This is by far the worst cast of anime characters I've ever seen. I found none of them to be likeable at all. the cast is so terrible that it drags the story into piss poor condition. I'm only going to mention the three main characters. First we got Makoto Itou. This guy is just the worst and he knows it, but doesn't seem to have a care in the world. Makoto just makes all his decisions without thinking about certain people without a damn given. His decisions at the first half were not done near as frequently as the second half. He make me yell at the screen every time he showed up in the second half. Sekai Saionji. This character didn't make sense from the beginning. she caused Makoto to go follow his instints, but Makoto had a choice. Sekai just sometimes makes some horribly illogical decisions like in the last episode. Now Kotonoha Katsura. From the beginning, she was the only character that I could tolerate, but her direction of being overly attached to someone like Makoto just makes an unlikable path for Kotonoha. The others? No! everyone just go to hell. I'm done!\n\n
School Days does deserve the reputation it gets. If your going to watch it to review it? Your funeral. If you are just looking for enjoyment? This will piss you the hell off. One of the worst anime I've seen thus far. \n\n
Overall (2/10)
