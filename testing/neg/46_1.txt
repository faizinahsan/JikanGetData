(Note: this review contains minor spoilers)
School Days seems to offer something that is different from the typical romance, harem, and high school anime; at the very least, it has an unusual protagonist in that he is selfish, takes any opportunity for sex, and doesn't have any concern for the feelings of others or take any responsibility for his own actions. However, the originality mostly stops there. The girls are mostly archetypes of this genre: the energetic friend, the sweet and quiet girl, the seemingly emotionless, distant observer (who also happens to look half her age), and the childhood friend. Where they differ from these clichésis that none of them are particularly admirable or innocent, and all of them will for the most part do whatever they can to get what they want, albeit sometimes in self-deception. This also goes for the protagonist’s best friend, who would, in most other anime of this genre, remain innocuously comical in any childishly underhanded ploys he might attempt.\n\n
The settings are also the same as those in most anime of this genre: a train, the classroom, a swimming pool, a school festival. However, the backdrop of this story is arguably more boring than any other high school anime in that there are practically no events in the series other than the tedious romantic interactions that are almost solely comprised of moments in which a girl character hesitates to kiss or have sex and moments when she doesn’t. There is no occasion or character goal to provide any kind of diverting relief from these scenes, and only just enough information about what is going on at school is given to set the stage for each “romantic” moment.\n\n
While keeping the ending in mind is beneficial in practically any series, usually providing more focus and purpose for each event and leading to a more satisfying conclusion, School Days seems to have been created solely for the ending and each episode leading up to it is an agony of compulsory delays until the final event. No life or passion seems to have been breathed into any of the happenings leading up to it and so it is difficult for the viewer to find any passion for them either.\n\n
Not only this, but such despicable characters were incredibly frustrating to watch. While there is some satisfaction to be had in some parts near and at the end, the loathsome choices of the protagonist and even some of the other characters were a torment to witness. Even what gratification might come from seeing the conclusion is tinged with nausea because of the way in which in comes about.\n\n
If the show lacks almost anything that might provide enjoyment and entertainment, one might wonder if it holds any value in themes or meaning. However, whatever moral or “deeper meaning” this story might have seems to be in the admonishment not to cheat, a piece of advice that even the most rampant cheaters have surely heard and understood before seeing this anime. I find it hard to believe that watching this show would play any part in whether or not someone decided to cheat on their significant other. The dire consequences of cheating are surely already blatantly obvious to anyone without seeing a grossly exaggerated demonstration of it.\n\n
For not only is this demonstration pointless, but it is done in a way that is far removed from almost any resemblance to reality. That this many girls would not only be interested in Itou, but also be willing to do whatever it takes for him and to each other in order to be the woman in his life is insulting to the viewer’s intelligence. Almost every girl character is willing to hop in the sack with hardly a moment's notice, some with the hope of thus securing his affections, others simply for the momentary satisfaction of it regardless of what they know about him or of their relationship to his other partners. \n\n
Not only this, but the perhaps pivotal reaction of one of these girls to what the protagonist has done is also incredibly far-fetched. That a girl with her kinds of innocent dreams and family ties would go into shock at the end of an, at best, rocky relationship with a crush she was never fully attached to seems unlikely. \n\n
Itou is for the most part the only saving grace for the show’s lack of realism, which isn’t saying much. Despicable though he is, it is not implausible to believe that a person this shallow exists or that he would react the way he does to the unrealistic number of girls that throw themselves at him. Infuriating though it is, his apathy toward the way they feel when they ask something of him in return and his boredom over time with each one is also plausible in the case of a person with such contemptible character and no desire or incentive to take responsibility for what he has done.\n\n
Anyone can relate to the moment when, if only because he is faced for the first time with actual consequences to his actions, he wakes up and realizes that he has made the biggest mistake of his life. Whether or not this sudden horrible realization would have a lasting affect on his character or simply drive a brief guilt-ridden gap in-between transgressions is difficult to say, though either path is plausible.\n\n
Similarly, there is some measure of relatability in the flawed character of Saionji in that she really manages to deceive herself about her own goals and motivations throughout the show. Regardless of her sometimes reprehensible decisions, her desperate effort to justify herself in her weakness is somehow heart wrenching and reminiscent of times when many of us have made mistakes while deceiving ourselves in the attempt to retain the mental image of the kind of person we believe and hope ourselves to be.\n\n
The three main female leads are all designed in such a way that they have a bit of a creepy look, with sharp contrast in coloring between complexion and hair and eye color, eyes too large and expressionless, and hair that juts out angularly before falling around their faces. This works well in foreshadowing the ultimately dark nature of the series, but each one is practically indistinguishable from the other except for their hair length. Along with this laziness in character design, the scenery is also given the bare minimum of detail. There is just enough for the viewer to comprehend the setting, and nothing else. What is there is also not particularly pleasing to look at.\n\n
On top of this, the lighting looks as though it all comes from a weak bulb in bad need of replacement and filtered through a filthy shade. It doesn’t clarify the picture, but rather dulls the lines, especially near the top of the image, reflecting off skin in such a way that it makes everything seem a bit difficult to make out and dulls the colors. Overall, School Days is painful to watch in more ways than one.\n\n
The actors’ voices do not sound professionally recorded at all. When one of them raises their voice, it has a sort of empty sound as though they are yelling in a vacant garage, and there is a bit of distortion as though they are using a bad microphone. So the sound of their voices is in general rendered unpleasant, on top of which their acting itself is a bit unnatural and far-fetched in tone.\n\n
The soundtrack is completely unremarkable, so much so that it’s almost impossible to find anything to say about it otherwise. The opening sequence has a nice rhythm and mood, though the ecchi makes its entrance a bit too suddenly and awkwardly in the second half, much as the fanservice does throughout the series itself. The ending song for each episode is different and every one of them has a suitable atmosphere for the episode that just ended and lyrics that convey some of the characters’ unspoken feelings, which manages to make an otherwise mind-numbingly dull show slightly more interesting.\n\n
I went into this anime with a very open and hopeful mind. After all, there is a great amount of vocal hatred for the anime Elfen Lied, Rumbling Hearts, and Mirai Nikki, but I managed to enjoy them all. So I thought that maybe there was some value that I would find in School Days that many did not and I didn’t want to judge it by someone else’s standards. However, even going into it with an open mind, I came to the conclusion that I should have stayed far away.\n\n
If you want to try School Days in the hopes that it will be completely different from the norm, be mindful that this comes at the expense of quality in every other area. There are no lessons to be learned, no pretty pictures to look at, no plot to hold your attention, and no characters to get attached to. The only recommendation I can give it is a suggestion to watch it simply because it is so bad. There is something morbidly fascinating in seeing something this abhorrent, and it can only help strengthen your appreciation for the good shows in this medium.
