This review WILL contain spoilers.
When I first got into School Days, I didn' know what I was getting myself into. I had heard about it, by people who either loved it or hated it. So I didn't know what to expect from it.
2 years later, I still don't know exactly what I watched.
Story: 4
The premise of School Days is simple; boy falls in love with girl but he doesn't exactly know how to approache her, so he gets help from another girl to get them together. Pretty innocent, right? Sure, I thought the same thing, a cute couple with a change of love blooming. Thingis, this is where things start to get out of control. He soon starts fooling around with other women, sleeping around with any girl who seems interested enough, basically saying "f*ck you" to everyone and the viewer. So I'm supposed to support this guy...? It's this out of the blue BS that gets thrown to your face, attepting to surprise to viewer.\n\n
I know it's regarded as  "psychological", and that "it's not supposed to be perfect because love's not perfect" blah, blah. I didn't see it. I only saw sh*tty decisions made by sh*tty characters.\n\n
The only reedeming thing about it, if I'd had to say, it's probably it's infamous endind that, if you haven't seen or even heard about, I won't spoil it for you. It's almost majestic. Just gonna say "nice boat." Yup.\n

It's a hit or miss. It's neither good or bad. I've seen worse. Some scenes look nice and others look dreadful. Okay-ish animation.\n\n
Sound: 5\n\n
Again, hit or miss. Some of the voice actors sound horrible, i.e Sekai. Soundtrack is eh.\n\n
Characters: 2\n\n
Seriously, the characters are the main reason I have such hatred towards this anime. Makoto f*cking Ito is probably the most pathetic, disgusting character I've ever had the misfortune of laying my eyes in. He has absolutely no godamn respect towards ANY of the characters he interacts (aka f*cks around with), is a selfish individual, and plays the victim when blamed for something. He has absolutely no personality whatsoever, he's basically a cardboardbox. Except not, because even cardboardboxes are more useful than him.\n\n
 "Oh, no, yeah he's a unlikeable character, but that doesn't make him a bad character!" Yes, it does. He's a disgusting character, he's not "deeply messed up, such emo, much need for the v" no, he's simply disgusting. Get over it.\n\n
Any other characters (which is 99% females, seriously, there's only two guys counting Makoto is this school, what the flying f*ck happened to the male population) are bland, maybe with the exception of Kotonoha, because seriously, I felt bad most of the time for her. The others were either sluts he slept with or unimportant characters.\n\n
Enjoyment: 2\n\n
No. No, no, no. Most of the time I was facepalming at the stupidity of the whole situation and how low life Makoto was. I was enraged, just hoping for the episodes to end so I could just get it over with. The only thing that brought me joy was the ending. I burst out laughing. It was beautiful.\n\n
Overall: 3\n\n
I hear that the visual novels are better. Can't confirm, since I never played them nor do I plan to. But this is by far the worst thing I ever had to sit through, and I would not recommend to anyone. Really. It's a waste of time.
