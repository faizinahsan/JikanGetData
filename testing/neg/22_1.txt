Summary: A shonen stiched together with boring slice of life filler with xvideos worthy character development going full steam ahead at the pace of a chronic illness.
So full disclosure i've fast forwarded through episode 80 to 111 not that I meant to from the start. I picked up the series again recently because I wanted to see if it picked up again and I was more then dissapointed. The story is as directionless as ever there is no goal in sight and Boruto ultimate goal may as well be to become a male prostitute or an airline pilot he's done about as much to reach. those goals as to reach the goal he set out for himself which is according to the show is be like sasuke. This is of course exagerated but not completely inacurate. The characters are all mostly boring and it's a stretch to even call them two dimensional i've seen porn with better character development. \n
update: I have now deleted all positive/hopefull things I said about this pile of shit. After suffering through another 15 episodes of this show I have come to the conclusion that all the cocaine and heroin in the world isn't enough to induce a sense of pleasure while watching this show. There is much more entertainment value in going out and picking yourself up a pet rock or a staph infection. But if you made it to the end I do have a special game that I devised. Every time Boruto yells "Dad" take a shot this works better on some episodes then others.
