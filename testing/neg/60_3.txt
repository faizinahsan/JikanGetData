Updating:
I am personally amazed that I managed to actually finish this show, but I some how kept hoping it would get better... and it didn't.
The first few episodes were like "okay, this is okay, generic, perverted, but okay"
then it turned into "okay, now just perverted and depressing, fanatical and insane"
only to transform into "what the bleeding hell were the writers thinking?!"
and by the end "..." 
All I can say is that this anime was relatively well done, for the type of show it is. So if you like your characters/plot sadistic, perverted, masochistic, insane, psycho and overly dramatic, you should watch this show.
However, if youlike your characters with a modicum of sanity, reasonable pervertedness, a tad of humor, and generally all their braincells... don't watch this. You might end up killing something, someone, or yourself.\n\n\n
My two cents, and now I shall go watch something that's not a total waste of time.\n\n\n
