Orright me mates!! This here is a classic anime me mates a classic deconstruction of the harem genre!!! It's a deconstruction because the main bloke bloody well shags all the fit anime birds doesn't he??? I'm telling you me mates you'll get a shock watching this!! I was eating me dinner when I watched it and I nearly spilled gravy all over me trousers!!!
This bloke Makoto is a complete bantersaurus a true lad!! First off I think he's just another chinese cartoon wussy boy with a limp willy but then he really turns it all around!!! He's into this bird right named Kotonoha more likeKotitnoha right me mates haha!! This is the kind of bird we like to pull if you know what I mean great honking tits and everything!! But she's got some weirdo complex and she's right scared of willies so what does our proper lad Makoto do when she gets all frigid?? Goes right for her friend Sekai!! Good on you Makoto!!\n\n
Soon word gets around and all the birds in the school want a bit of Makoto so what does he do?? Well he bloody well shags them doesn't he?? Even the skinny bint with no breasts at all!! Haha the absolute madman!!!!\n\n
Sekai can't handle the banter so she uses all kinds of tricks to get Makoto to stay!! She even says she's pregnant what a typical woman!!! Makoto's tired of her whinging so what does he do?? Well he's shagged all the rest of them so he goes back to Kotonoha because he still hasn't given her a bit of the old Makoto meat!! Absolutely bloody brilliant!!!\n\n
Well Sekai wasn't having any of that and she right well gave him a piece of her mind in the end too!! Oops me mates I don't want to spoil anything but what a SHOCKER!!! Well with a lad like Makoto he was always going to end up in trouble with the birds wasn't he??? I'm telling you me mates you have got to watch School Days!!!
