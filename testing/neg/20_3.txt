"The Sequel No One Asked For But Still Got"
It took me 40 episodes to realize that whatever the first Naruto had, Boruto lacks completely. This show is as much of a disappointment as a sequel to the original, as it is as a stand alone show.
PLOT - Dreadfully slow. The plot has had no real development since the first episode, nothing really happens. It's just this slice of life bullshit that doesn't build character at all, just random missions. The fact that the Genin-level main cast can deal with Chuunin-Jounin level shinobi on a frequent basis is just awful writing.
ART - If there was savinggrace for this show, it's the art. The animation is good, colorful and vivid, worthy for a Shonen anime.\n\n
SOUND - Nothing to write home about. The music is just there to complement the animation but none of the soundtracks remain in the memory after the episode ends. \n\n
CHARACTERS - Atrocious copies of the former cast. Boruto is a poor excuse for a main character. An entitled, whiny brat that hates his father. That's the whole shtick Boruto has got going on for himself. The same goes for the other kids with the only exception being Mitsuki who is kinda interesting.\n\n
VERDICT - Save yourself the time and skip this poor excuse of a sequel
