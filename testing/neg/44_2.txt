School Days is just one giant piece of fanservice, and that is it. If you are looking for your typical high school romance, this is not it. This anime takes the "perverted harem" genre to a whole new level-with some surprising and extremely unneccessary twists. The anime starts out average enough- you have your unexperienced, yet cute main boy, the shy girl he has a crush on, and the tsunedere who secretly likes him, but is in denial. The first half of the series revolves around their love triangle. Interesting enough.Throw in some uneccessary boob, crotch, and panty shots while you're at it.
Then all ofa sudden, Makoto (the guy) becomes a manwhore. All of a sudden, every female cast member has a crush on him, despite prior interactions, and he has sex with them all. You really grow to feel bad for the two original girls-Sekai and Katsura- who still love Makoto, despite him being a horny bastard. Katsura, especially, is bullied for unneccessary reasons. The later half of the series is just random, pointless sex- which makes sense, considering School Days is also a hentai game.\n
The climax of the series is what this anime is best known for. I will not write any spoilers, but it is unexpected and VERY creepy.\n
Some may say this anime takes a &quot;psychological&quot; look at high school relationships. If you want a psychological view on high school relationships, please watch Kare Kano. This is mindless fodder. In one of the episodes, some of the girls place a video camera in a room at the school festival where kids have sex and then show the tape to everyone, for crying out loud!\n
Don't waste your time on this unless you're really perverted, or you're curious to why the fuck it ends the way it does.
