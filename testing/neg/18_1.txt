Yikes, just yikes. Because of my love for Naruto I really tried to delude myself into thinking this show wasn't that bad. But really, what else is there to say about Boruto other than it's an utter disgrace. Like most others I wanted to watch this show because I'm sentimental when it comes to Naruto, making it that much worse of a betrayal. "Wow brotato chip you're sounding pretty salty." Ding Ding Ding we have a winner! 
To say the show reeks of a money grab is an understatement. Like driving without a steering wheel, the show has no direction. To begin the show theytry to reel you in with a spoiler that is so ludicrous that it gets to the point where it almost tarnishes the image of Naruto. \n\n
Story: Not much to say, there is no plot. You really can't analyze any kind of story here because it just doesn't exist. We thought the shinobi world would be slower after Naruto but nobody even has a goal or purpose in life anymore. There's no driving force for any individual, village, or nation. There is one character in the show that has a goal and a purpose (Sarada Uchiha). \n\n
Characters: The whole idea of the hokage stamping papers 24/7 was funny in Naruto but they took it way too far in Boruto. The only thing we've seen Naruto do is stamping papers. They took this to the point where Naruto is a terrible father who is completely absent at home and just sends shadow clones for important family matters, such as his kids birthday. Truly disgusting and disgraceful. \n\n
Almost all of the main characters are the exact copies of the characters from Naruto. They all have the same appearance, personality, justsu, etc. The only slight difference between the main cast and their parents is a different name. Writing does not get more lazy than that ladies and gentlemen. \n\n
The show has no story, no action, no comedy, yada yada yada. It is the epitome of cheap trash, milking the hearts of anime fans until they look like shriveled old hags like Lady Tsunade. When there is no drug in existence that can make this show funny or entertaining in any way, you know there's a problem. \n\n
I would much rather prefer to have a show that is constantly on hiatus, but has exceptional writing and a story that is thrilling, intelligent, and compelling like Hunter x Hunter. Boruto/Naruto should've just taken a page out of the Yu Yu Hakusho handbook and ended it on a high note. Instead we are given a show that makes a mockery of anime. \n\n
Overall/Enjoyment: If I try to find any silver lining it is Sarada Uchiha who is the only interesting character and provides the only chance for Boruto to have a story in the future. Unfortunately, I don't think that's gona happen. I cannot further emphasize that unless you wana have your intelligence insulted and to bear witness to the metaphorical manifestation of Boruto/Kishimoto spitting on Naruto's grave, stay away!\n\n
I'll offer this parting quote from the great Billy Madison as my condolences. Kishimoto listen: "What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."\n
