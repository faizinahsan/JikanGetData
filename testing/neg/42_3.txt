School days is a terrible show that is completely dependent on its ending. Otherwise, it wouldn't even be relevant to us.
Think about it, remove that "moment" from this show and what do we get? A poorly animated, poorly written story that needs a big kick at the end to leave somewhat of an impression.
None of the characters in this show are likable, and all of them are simply nonsensical. There's nothing special about the male MC, and yet all the girls are flaunting their bodies to him. Sekai is a braindead character. Just watching her made me lose some brain cells. Why did she introducea girl to the guy that she likes? Is love a game to her? (clearly it's not) Also, associating the word "love" to this show is blasphemy. If you think that this show is about love, you are misguided. This show sucks so bad that even the author realized it.\n\n
So instead of ending it normally, he decided to make an unforgettable ending to make up for the disgrace of a story he came up with. And it was still terrible.
