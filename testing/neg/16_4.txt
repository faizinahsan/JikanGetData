I heard of Sword Art Online from almost every single anime media when it released. People were singing praises about this apparently highly anticipated anime. Going in expecting an enjoyable experience, I was completely let down. SAO is probably the most overrated anime so far
Both the art and sound were done extremely well, as expected from such a high budget anime. 
Being a gamer myself, i was intrigued by the story, but it was terribly executed.
To me, the characters are the greatest downfall of this anime. The main leads, Kirito and Asuna, are some of the most unrealistic and boring characters. Kirito, with absolutely noflaws, a ladiesman despite being a shut-in, changes his personality ridiculously. He acts completely different when facing different characters just to fit the required story at that point and changes from a cool loner to a bloody family man. Makes no sense. And with the ever perfect Asuna, no flaws or defining traits of any kind, make up some of the most uninteresting duo in anime history. Even the side characters are weak for side characters. The only character i would remotely stand was Suguha, at least see had an inch of depth.\n\n
Maybe i had too high expectations, but this anime was terrible for me. And it got worst and worst as it continued until it was absolutely unbearable\n\n
An anime which doesn't deserve the attention it gets, i do not recommend this. Don't expect much, or in fact, expect anything at all.
