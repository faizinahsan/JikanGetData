I think it's second time i really had to write a review on MAL.
After watching 34 episodes now. I reaaally dont understand why there are any ratings/reviews with score more than 4/5 (there are many 10/10... Wait, what?). It's not about if you like where the series went or now. This show is just bad. It's really hard to point any good sides of it.
As watching end of shippuden (won't comment it) i felt like it was different from what Kishimoto was planning to do on the end. And 'Next Generations' wasn't in his mind for sure~
I really would like to know his honest opinionabout this show.\n\n
For me, nearly every episode of this show was on the level of average bad filler in last "two seasons" (i really don't want to call it a third one... but for sake of that i'll do it), because story and animations are rather on the same level. But even if so, the thing i hate the most in this anime is its overflowing idiocy. "Nakama power", changing facts, really stupid "plot armor" things... few eg.:\n\n\n
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LITTLE SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n
Like Sarada few weeks after getting Sharingan, she was already use it like "Copying Ninja Kakashi" in his might..... (oh, and fights against one char\n\n
Or stuff like because of plot suddenly Hogake (aka strongest shinobi) can't do **** against 'powerful' monster, when his son is able to easly fight him (oh, and that monster became their pet) (and wasn't it because beast could absorb chakra? if so, anyone remember Boruto's movie? anyone?).\n\n
Or again weak Naruto wasn't able in Tailed Beast Mode catch some small jumping weakling, he needed actually sarada's help - PLOT.\n
Well, mainly whole thread about Shin was bad... (anyone thinks as me that Sakura is actually doing something aaand is stronger than Naruto now?)\n\n
Boruto and Sarada being able to fight (without much training, time of peace, main subject in that season... still in school) against group of assasins (whole country's level, killing political enemies, planing to make a revolt~) with Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist's swords who were actually able to fight against mizukage (probably he was suddenly weak as Naruto.... those kages, right?)\n
and much more~\n\n\n\n
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! END OF SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n
I understand that making friened from litterally everyone was Naruto's thing. But somehow it doesnt do the trick here. Maybe it's from fact that, as someone said, he is most annoying character in the show, and with all other flaws. it's becoming next irritating thing. Next to flat characters, no story, bad animations~\n\n\n
STORY 1/10\n
There is not too much to say here. After bad spoiler (copy of the one from start of shippuden, for me it was worst part of second season and they used it) which tries to bait us to watch next 600-700 episodes and spoiling something that probably doesn't contain any story behind it, just clear info with who boruto will fight, anime leaves us with mostly not-related episodes (max long threads go for few episodes), what with connection with flat characters makes it not worth watching. You really can leave those and still dont lose nearly anything from the story.\n\n\n
ART 3/10\n
Again i can't say anything good about this part too. Without few scenes from all episodes which had some deepth in it, animation is somewhere on level of fillers. Some episodes even reminds me those buddget animes with everytime same plot like "main hero gets to new school, see girl's underwear, she wants duel with him (she is also strongest in school), and suddenly she realize he is really strong new one"ish. I'll even dare to say that even if old, i think i prefere art style from first season.\n\n\n
SOUND 8/10\n
Probably the only one thing that's good in this show. Mainly soundtrack isn't on high level and doesn't make you want to hear it again and again like in Naruto's case (eg. Emergence of Talents) (quickly becomes boring, not so emotional), but Openings and Endings are really great and it's something i added to my mp3 list on my phone.\n\n\n
CHARACTERS 1/10\n
I think the same thing as MAL's rating system's comment behind number 1 - Pathetic. \n
How i said, all characters all just flat and even if building story by some events like that in first season worked, they forgot to add anything to their characteristics. It's just shapeless mass. Episodes just jump from random school or other events feeling us with forgetable things. Sarada is the only one person that still keeps me 'watching' this show.\n\n\n
ENJOYMENT 1/10\n
Enjo.... what? is that delicious? As i wateched pretty many animes already and never actually drop one, lately Boruto's episodes takes me around 5min to watch, because i'm skipping in moments when "too boringm turn it off" feeling cames back. Really trying my best here :C\n\n\n
Overall 1/10\n
Because this is a lowest possible one. \n\n\n
I see what are they trying to do, without much idea for universum, just milking it. It's alike to the situation of Star Wars right now. Just throwing memories, characters very well known to watchers, just to keep them watching (without even trying because, fans will watch it anyway, right?), while making it 'kids friendly'/stupid/colorful (only light colors)/easy to watch (choose one) just to lure new fans, Which is probably the thing i hate the most.\n\n
I don't give this anime a chance for becoming better with time. Especially because while for now copying and using memories characters of first two seasons works. It wont work forever. There will be time when in Naruto, they used all gathered memories and hero's expierience for heroic moments etc., Boruto will have no ground to stand on.\n\n
As a fan, not from 2002, but as big as such, I'm really scared about what they are going to do with breaking the rules of universum. How Sarada will get the EMS (c'mon, it's sure thing, but impossible to achive by her now). And I'm sure for now they will continue to stuff that big filler under name "Boruto: Naruto Next Generations" with remembered characters. And i can asure they will introduce us some new Uchiha (too good stuff to not to use it) or coming back to other well known characters (don't even dare to use Jiraya, Itachi or Shizui D: ), and i can asure you it won't be good as well.\n\n
But it's going off the review so on the end, I'm going to say to watch few episodes, and develop your own opinion, but you should know it is something you won't be able to unsee~\n\n
With a sadness and need to watch first Naruto again - StarAlone
