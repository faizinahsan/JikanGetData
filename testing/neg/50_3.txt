Overview:
Today we review School Days. A tale set in Victorian London that serves as an example to children  of how to become an ideal British gentlemen. Wait...that's Tom Brown's School Days by Thomas Hughes! What are we reviewing? Oh GOD NO! Unfortunately, we will be looking at that OTHER School Days. (sighs heavily).
Plot: 3/10
The plot is that there is an obnoxious little shit named Makoto that is filled with angst that he is in high school and is still a virgin. So this is going to be an anime American Pie right? Right? No, instead we have to see this guy plow every girlin the grade and have zero remorse when he breaks their hearts. Why the girls keep falling for this creep is never really established other than the tired stereotype of "girls like bastards". Although this almost seems like it could be interesting or some kind of thought provoking critique of teen sex comedies, this series wallows in poorly written melodrama and the first half is SLOW as a 3 toed sloth moving through jello. Will Makoto eventually get his comeuppance? Honestly, who cares!? After about episode 5 you will just want to quit. Only continue if you are a true masochist!\n\n
Characters: 4/10\n\n
I gave it a few extra points by having the balls to have such a complete scum bag as the main character. At least School Days had some guts, even if it is just based on the concept of making all the bad choices in an ero dating sim. The main girls are Sekai and Kotonoha, and I honestly hated both of them! A lot! There isn't a single character in this cesspool that makes you feel attached to them or cheer for them! Other than maybe one of Kotonoha's actions in episode 13. I cheered for that at least!\n\n
Sound: 5/10\n\n
The soundtrack is average. It isn't great, but it isn't horrendous either.\n\n
Art: 7/10\n\n
The art is actually pretty good. If I had to pick a "highlight" in this piece of shit, it would be the character art. Makoto does have one of those faces that you just want to punch again and again ala Ladd Russo from Baccano! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHsUfuFVRSQ\n\n
Enjoyment: 2/10\n\n
This series is about as fun as getting an arrow shot through your neck, and then finding a gas bill attached.\n\n
Overall: 3/10\n\n
I'm honestly not sure why I rated this as high as I did. I guess the art is actually decent, it has some production value, and it took a chance being ballsy. At times it almost seemed like it could have worked. Perhaps as a black comedy that critiques and skewers teen sex comedies. Unfortunately, this series lacked direction and any kind of proper execution.\n\n
