School Days is based off an eroge of the same name released some time ago.  Already a problem arises: the producers intended to translate this type of game into an airing tv series.  Seriously now...
The game is basically a series of animations cued depending on whichever branching paths the player inputs.  There are 3 possible endings for the game, which we'll look into a little further into this review.
There's the male protagonist, Makoto, his female friend Sekai (oshit, no wai!), and some other girl the guy's interested in Katsura.  Words cannot even begin to describe how ridiculously predictable this seems. Basically,its a love triangle, guy gets new girl, other girl gets jealous, BOOM! congradulations a bloody fricken original plot is born....again...for the 407th time.  You'd think that this is your standard romance story, but oh hoh no. it get worse. Worse beyond belief. Again, we'll look into it a little further down.  What's tragic is that there are some decent themes that could have been emphasized like destroying friendships for your own selfish desires.\n\n
Characters. The elements that either captivate viewers with their performances enchanting them into progressing further and further along the story OR f*ck it up.  School days...does both.  No I'm not a pothead.  These children have the sexual instincts of sewer rats, emotional habits of blueberries and personalities that almost shine brighter than sandpaper.  Seriously, the actions each character exhibits causes one to cry oneself to sleep shortly after the ending theme starts every episode.  At least, that's how i reacted.  Others may howl in terror or laugh in disbelief.  These stereotypes cannot seem to grasp common sense and strictly rely on their sexual urges and...even more sexual urges.  I couldnt believe this was actually happening.  Do japanese highschoolers really get into this sh*t? What really drove me to keep watching until the end was to see how much sh*t these kids got into. In a way, it was worth it to finally see them drown in it.\n\n
The art direction gets the job done (whatever sick job it is) and delivers recognizeable backgrounds and characters. However, I've seen stick figure with more life than these characters exhibit.  Although easily recognizeable the models are boring as hell and are terribly bland.\n\n
The sound is easily School Days' highest point.  Unbelieveably, the songs are impressive and the voice acting, while lacking personality and passion, delivers enough to give whatever life it can to the characters. But seeing as all this seems to go to waste being used in a failed abortion such as this, the bubbling sound of ripping ass at least seems more entertaining.\n\n
*WARNING SPOILERS IN NEXT 2 PARAGRAPH*\n
It's truly amazing how the these kids would willingly let themselves be fondled by douchebags just to practice for another girl.  wtf. Sekai, who secretly loves Makoto says she lets him go for Katsura because she loves him and wants to support him.  seriously what the fucking shit. The parents of these kids seem to not notice or give a shit when they hear the bed springs in their daughter's room bending and the sound of moaning ang groaning seeps through the walls.  Oyea and realizing "Oh noes, vat hav i done!" after you stab a guy to death requires no comment...\n\n
The real element that makes this series legendary is the "nice boat" ending.  It is an original ending which differed from the three endings of the game. in the game: (1) Sekai + makoto walk along bridge, Katsura shows up, slices Sekai's neck, blood shoots out her neck like a garden hose, and Katsura laughs like a Joker. (2) Sekai stabs Makoto at beach...thats it. and (3) the two bitches get along and are just about to have a threesome.\n
The anime ending: Sekai stabs Makoto in room and Katsura takes head, kills sekai and checks her womb for bebez, then drifts off on her nice boat grasping makoto's decapitated head into her tits and she lived happily ever after. the fuckin end.\n\n
If anything, I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to see how f*cked some animes can be, how cliched they can be, how an overused love triangle theme is f*cked with to the lowest degree, or how many times this series spells ass.  You'll despise the characters for their utter stupidity and you will enjoy their plummet into hell.  Also, if you want to know why the fuck people are talking about the "nice boat" either in public or 4chan, watch it and love to hate it as i have.\n\n
Oyea one more thing. I'm not entirely sure but i think in the game, every other girl in the anime gets fucked........as in...by makoto........in the vagina
